      <b>Planner's comments</b></p>
      <p align="left">
      Many years ago I tried a couple of night events. I can remember having 
      difficulty just following the paths. So when I started planning the 
      courses for St Leonards I simplified them to make an allowance for the 
      dark. However, Vince advised me that they should be planned to TD5. This 
      is difficult to achieve on an area like St Leonards due to the large 
      number of paths. I really needed to set legs across the paths but much of 
      the forest was covered with bracken and/or brashings and avoiding the 
      worst bits limited the areas that I could use. Although some path running 
      was unavoidable I did find some areas where I could set legs that rewarded 
      good navigation on the ‘straight line’ route. I hope you enjoyed them.<br>
      <br>
      Planning the event took up about 7 days of my time but it had its rewards. 
      Planning the courses was good fun and I spent some lovely days wondering 
      and running around the forest. Setting up and running the event was very 
      enjoyable despite that challenges that resulted from the loss of the car 
      park. I also appreciated your feedback which was very positive.<br>
      <br>
      Collecting in the controls on the Saturday night was a test of nerves. 
      Everyone had left and the pathetic light from my small torch didn’t 
      penetrate very far through the blackness that surrounded me. I kept 
      hearing odd noises and started humming a little tune to settle myself but 
      I had to stop when I realised it was “Phantom of the Opera”. Then I 
      discovered that one of the controls had gone; then another. I was not 
      alone! As I approached car park I could see the lights of another car. 
      Police? Thieves? The Phantom? No, it turned out to be Mike. He had gone 
      out to collect the tapes leading back from the finish only to find I had 
      already done it. When he tried to retrace his steps he couldn’t find the 
      path and end up completely lost. Without a map or a compass the only way 
      he could find his way back was to keep heading up to the highest point 
      where he knew there was a forest track that he could follow back to the 
      car park. That turned out to be a 2 km hike!<br>
      <br>
      I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for allowing us to use St 
      Leonards. Also the Moles who helped on the night and cope admirably well 
      with the loss of the car park. Finally, a big ‘thank you’ to Vince for all 
      of his advice, which resulted in much better courses.<br>

      <p align="left">
      Mark’s first draft courses were technically a bit easy so on my advice he 
      made some adjustments and came up with an excellent set of courses which 
      would test the best night orienteers in the South East and it is a shame 
      the turnout was so low. </p>
      <p align="left">
      The winning time on each course was about where we expected it to be and 
      most people seemed to enjoy their courses so a good job, well done Mark.<br>

      <b>Organiser's Comments</b></p>
      <p align="left">
      Apologies for the Car Park on the night. The gate beside 
      Registration/Download car was scheduled to be open and the car park behind 
      the Church used. By the time it became apparent that the key-holder would 
      not be arriving it was too late to move everything to the Forestry 
      Commission's Roosthole Car Park.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to Tom, Jon, Peter and Keith for helping on the night and to the 
      competitors for braving the appalling temperatures of +10C, the dry 
      conditions and the clear skies (all the conditions expected at the end of 
      November!!).<br>
      <br>
      The results list the SE Nights medal winners (you should note that these 
      differ from the list displayed at Hankley on Sunday), and the medals will 
      be with me at Puttenham (4th December), Ightam (11th December) and Ranmore 
      (18th December).<br>
