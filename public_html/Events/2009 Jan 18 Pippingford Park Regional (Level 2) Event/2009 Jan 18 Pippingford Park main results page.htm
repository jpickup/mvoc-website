        I would like to record thanks to:
        <p>Robert 
        Lines of Southdowns&nbsp;for supplying the maps and then&nbsp;answering my many 
        queries on how to run the string course,</p>
        <p>Juliet &amp; India 
        Nicolson for running the string course on the day - a special effort 
        considering that they are not orienteers.</p>

&nbsp;<p><b>A note from the Planner</b></p>
      <p>Two “problems” arose on the day, one of which was totally unexpected whilst 
      the second had, I thought, been sorted out well beforehand. </p>
      <p>The second of these “problems” 
      requires, for all those competitors involved, a full explanation, so here 
      goes:</span></p>
      <p>In December the 
      Training area authority told me to avoid the area in the vicinity of one 
      of the troop shelters (F). This was easy, but knowing there were another 
      units on area I contacted the Authority but hit the Christmas break. On 
      their return in January I was informed that the unit was Tonbridge 
      School Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and to ensure that there would be no 
      conflict of use contacted the Officer Commanding the unit after their 
      Christmas break (January 7). </p>
      <p>I found out where they would be, 
      on the Middle Bridge, and explained where we would be. He had no problems 
      with orienteers crossing the bridge that all the courses in that area had 
      been planned to cross. (The stream/river in that area, as many now know, 
      is fast and deep even without the previous night's rain swelling it by 2 or 
      3 feet.) In order to ensure de-confliction with the CCF unit an 
      out-of-bounds screen was added to the course overprint, and in the cool 
      light of day on the computer screen and on the ink-jet proofs it appears 
      obvious to me that the road is useable. With hindsight I should have put 
      an edge next to the road or a crossing point to make it more obvious.</span></p>
      <p>On the Sunday 
      morning, after all the controls were out and checked, I went to the area 
      the CCF unit were training in and had a conversation with the Officer 
      Commanding them, explaining where the competitors would be coming from and 
      he again said there would be no problems with orienteers crossing the 
      bridge (I even gave him timings of between 10:30 and 1:30 so that he knew 
      it would be an extended period). I do not now why the CCF Cadets were 
      stopping runners from using the bridge, as at no time was it suggested 
      that this would happen.</span></p>
      <p>As a result of the 
      problems encountered by some, the leg from control 218 has been removed 
      from the final results. The ranking data will be submitted using the final 
      results and the allocation of the badge time has also been done on the 
      final results.</span></p>
      <p>Now the for the 
      strange but true problem concerning control 217:</span></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>10 months ago an 
      unknown control collector for the JK dropped control 213 in the woods 
      about 100 metres from where it had been collected. On Sunday Charlie Turner 
      (SLOW) found it about 25 metres from control 217. Neither the planner nor 
      the controller had seen it in a total of 5 visits, probably because we 
      were never looking for a control. After Charlie had found it a large 
      number of other competitors also found it, some saw it was the wrong code 
      and continued on to the correct one, some saw it was the wrong code and 
      thought it to be a planner's error (after all why should there be 2 
      controls on the same feature) and punched it and some just punched it 
      because the code was 21?. (Some never saw it at all). As all competitors 
      visiting 217/213 punched at at least one of the controls no one has been 
      disqualified for not punching 217. The split times for 217 have been 
      adjusted as the rogue controls timer was about 2 minutes different from 
      the real control's timer.</span></p>
      <p>(It should be noted 
      that the battery on SportIdent BSF8 units will last at least 10 months in 
      the forest and survive at least 6 consecutive days below freezing, but by 
      then the kite will be covered in moss and lichen)</span>.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Now the thankyous:</span></p>
      <p>To all those who 
      came and ran and seemed to enjoy it, and especially those who thanked the 
      officials.</span></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>To Nick Green who 
      helped put out controls on Saturday and all those Moles who hung around as 
      it got colder and then went out to collect controls on the Sunday.</span></p>
      <p>To Mike Murray for 
      controlling</span></p>
