      <p class="MsoNormal">This was probably the hardest planning job I have had 
      to tackle, for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;1)<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span>There 
      is no option other than to use the street parking near the North of the 
      map; at this time of year all fields are unusable for parking and the cost 
      of bussing would have been prohibitive.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">2) The new part of the map (Colley Hill) which I was 
      keen to use is remote from the main technical area on Banstead Common, and 
      the area between does not offer much other than long runs across grass or 
      paths (although the thickets can be confusing).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">3) There was no previous map of Colley Hill, and the 
      map generally was not finished until a very short time before the event, 
      so most of the planning had to be done using the old map of Banstead 
      Common and the Ordnance Survey map of Colley Hill.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -36.0pt; margin-left: 36.0pt">4) 
      The new competition rules required two or three more courses than one is 
      used to for District events.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -36.0pt; margin-left: 36.0pt">5)<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I 
      had not previously used OCAD!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I wanted as many of you as possible to experience 
      Colley Hill, as well as have plenty of opportunity to enjoy the 
      depressions, pits, knolls, earthbanks and re-entrants further North; which 
      meant a long walk to the start and a remote start for the blue course, 
      which was not ideal.&nbsp; There was also a cunning plan to have long running 
      legs first followed by short tricky legs later on, in order to test 
      navigational skills after the physical demands had taken their toll.&nbsp; I 
      was pleased to hear several comments about the “teasing” and “tricky” 
      nature of the courses, as that was what I was attempting to achieve!&nbsp; I 
      have not at the time of writing studied the results in detail, but my 
      impression is that there were some impressively quick times.&nbsp; I expect 
      there were some slow ones too.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;You may not have liked the weather much but it did 
      keep some of the horse riders and dog walkers indoors, and although you 
      may have thought the scarp slope was slippery I must say it was a lot 
      worse the previous day!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;My thanks go particularly to:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Mike Elliot for the vast number of hours put in on 
      surveying and drawing the map and for helping me out with OCAD;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;John Faller for his helpful and co-operative 
      controlling, many of the technical control sites certainly required a 
      second opinion;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Ian Ditchfield for his OCAD tuition;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Neil Lewer for organising everything to run so 
      smoothly on the day;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;My teams of control hangers and collectors;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The landlord of the Sportsman for allowing us to 
      park there while control hanging (they do excellent meals by the way!)</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Purdey, my dog, for keeping me company on planning 
      visits.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">And finally, you the competitors for coming!&nbsp; And as 
      a final thought, there are many features on Colley Hill which I didn’t 
      know about in time which I am sure a future planner will be able to 
      exploit – so come back when you can!</p>

      <td width="100%"><font face="Times New Roman">A week's nervousness at what 
      the snow clouds would drop on us had resulted in some contingency being 
      included for the Brown and Blue courses, should it have been deemed unsafe 
      to send you down the Colley Hill slope.&nbsp; When I emerged through my front 
      door at 6:00am to find the snow falling quite heavily, I have to admit I 
      feared the worst.&nbsp; Thankfully the snow stopped, the sun came out and not 
      only could the event go ahead, but we were able to use Simon's Brown and 
      Blue courses to their maximum potential - I trust you all enjoyed the view 
      as you began your descent!&nbsp; Hopefully the occasional snow flurry also 
      added to the experience!</font><p><font face="Times New Roman">We had just 
      over 100 EOD competitors - far more than anticipated (especially in view 
      of the weather) - for what was essentially an event promoting pre-entry 
      via Club Captains.&nbsp; My only disappointment was hearing about some of the 
      comments directed at the Registration Team regarding EOD map availability 
      - even as late as 12:00pm!&nbsp; Whilst I'm sorry for any EOD competitors who 
      couldn't run the course of their choice due to maps running out, this was 
      not the Registration Team's fault and I would ask people to bear in mind 
      that certain comments may dissuade volunteers from helping out at future 
      events.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thanks are due to many people.&nbsp; In no 
      particular order:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Simon who, as well as Planning some 
      excellent courses, also initiated some of the earlier Organising duties!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To John Faller, for Controlling.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Mike, for his many hours spent 
      re-surveying and updating the map (including the addition of Margery Wood 
      and Colley Hill) and also for looking after the computer side of things on 
      the day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Tony Rozier (Banstead Commons 
      Conservators) and Andrew Wright (National Trust) for allowing us use of 
      the respective areas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Nick Green, for handling the 
      pre-entries (including a very short-notice amendment to the Start Lists!) 
      and also for compiling the results spreadsheet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To Dave Barrow and members of Tadworth 
      Cricket Club for the use of their nice warm pavilion and the provision of 
      some welcome refreshments.&nbsp; Bacon butties have never smelt, or tasted, so 
      good!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">To all of you for coming and making the 
      event a success, in spite of the weather!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Last, but by no means least, to the 
      intrepid band of Mole Helpers for all their hard work on the day - 
      particularly the early birds who helped get the controls out in good time, 
      and those on Parking and Start duties who braved the elements for a couple 
      of hours before and after their runs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In closing, congratulations to SO, SLOW, 
      SOS and GO in qualifying for the Final - we wish them well in representing 
      the South-East.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">The area looks deceptively simple, acres of grassland 
      with a few strips of trees.&nbsp; On the face of it, not very challenging.&nbsp; How 
      wrong!&nbsp; The wide open grassland required quite accurate headings at speed 
      whilst the forested areas demanded a slowing down and careful navigation.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Simon’s courses were certainly not easy and required 
      competitors to be alert right from the start.&nbsp; The longer courses visiting 
      Colley hill were introduced to include significant climb, a feature 
      missing from the main area of the map.&nbsp; It was interesting watching 
      competitors from the brow of the hill from where their route choice could 
      be clearly seen.&nbsp; What was apparent was the wide variety of choices made, 
      some attacking the steep slope head on, others taking a more gradual but 
      longer route.&nbsp; Thankfully, it was possible to use the hill for the event.&nbsp; 
      A survey on Saturday revealed an intermittent covering of snow with the 
      slope very greasy however this had dried out significantly overnight.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It was nice to see in the results that all the 
      competitors on the light coloured courses completed their runs, the 
      winners in quite impressive times.&nbsp; These courses were for their 
      respective competitors, quite as challenging as the technical courses were 
      for the older Orienteers.&nbsp; Indeed, well done to all.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The blizzard which I encountered early on Sunday 
      morning clearly dissuaded many competitors.&nbsp; The results indicating that 
      about 10% did not show up at the start.&nbsp; This was a pity since the actual 
      running conditions were in the main good with only the later runners 
      encountering snow.&nbsp; The corresponding reduction in cars however must have 
      been a relief for the Organiser (Neil) since car parking was undoubtedly 
      his biggest problem.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">As expected, the team of helpers did their respective 
      duties efficiently.&nbsp; Many thanks to Neil and his team, to Simon for the 
      courses and of course to Mole Valley for staging the event. </p>

      The Start and Finish boxes (plus check and clear) were programmed some 2 
      hours after the forest units (on the same PC). Unnoticed by me there was a 
      distortion of the timer in OE2003 and a time lag of approximately 1 minute 
      was built into the times on the later boxes. 
      <p>This was only noticed the 
      following morning (at 08:00) when the Start, Finish etc woke up at 08:01 
      (or thereabouts). This lag results in the time to control 1 being 1 minute 
      longer than it should be and the time from the last control to the finish 
      being 1 minute shorter.</p>
      <p>OE2003 timing takes the elapsed time as being 
      that from the start box to the finish box. Both the Start and Finish boxes 
      were coordinated and hence elapsed times are unaffected.</p>
