          I hope you all enjoyed your courses and did not find the bleak weather
          or the Ashdown terrain too inhospitable, thanks to Mike for his
          relaxed and efficient controlling and thanks to you all, for the
          positive comments on the courses.&nbsp; I also trust that early
          starters were not too inconvenienced by the delayed starts and hope
          this did not detract from your enjoyment of the day.

        <p class="MsoNormal">I had my arm twisted soon after returning from
        Hungary after the summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering
        that I have already organised - albeit with assistance - a Badge event
        this year, I reluctantly agreed, even though I knew that this time of
        year is usually filled with 16 hour days and 7 day weeks for me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>In spite of that I enjoyed the challenge and I was very ably
        assisted yet again by Mark Rowe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thanks
        Mark!!</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
        &nbsp;We had the usual problem of not being able to park, start or
        finish on Ashdown Forest, which necessitated parking in Pippingford
        Manor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I hope the 800 metres
        walk to the pre-start and a few hundred metres from there to the start
        triangle did not inconvenience you too much.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Another slight problem appeared in the shape of a whole Army
        troop complete with a dozen or so vehicles in and around our computing
        hut, but they were extremely friendly and accommodating by clearing out
        just in time for us to take up residence in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I hope that the few remaining blank shots in the vicinity of the
        Start did not frighten anyone.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
        &nbsp;Finally, I have to make my apologies for the delay in starting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I leave the detailed explanations to the Planner and/or
        Controller, but I hope that my efforts at providing all of you with as
        much information as I had at the time and keeping you in your warm cars
        as long as possible saved inconvenience to some degree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Apologies again to those I missed and who have already departed
        for the Start.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
        Controller let you go even before all SI boxes were out, I hope nobody
        caught anything too debilitating in the cold.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
        &nbsp;I must thank all the helpers, who braved the cold weather and the
        stresses resulting from the delayed start with great fortitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Thanks go also to the Pippingford Estate, the British Army, to
        the Conservators of Ashdown Forest and to Brigadier Constantine allowing
        us to enjoy the beauty and challenge of this prime orienteering area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I hope to see all of you at the National Event on Box Hill, White
        Hill and Headley Heath on February 9<sup>th</sup> next year.</p>

          My conversations with competitors at the finish were all complimentary
          and Nigel is to be congratulated on producing fine courses which
          received little or no amendment from me.<br>
        </div>
        <div>
          I was particularly pleased with the junior courses which encouraged
          simple navigation with winning times well under&nbsp;30 minutes.<br>
        </div>
        <div>
          Marking up maps out of competition time is a particularly good idea,&nbsp;
          Can anyone else remember being given 15 minutes to do this in a well
          lit room with table and chair to hand?&nbsp; Recent grotty map marking
          weather has forced us to mark up in dingy, damp and overcrowded tents
          or under tarpaulines.<br>
        </div>
        <div>
          Congratulations to all the finishers and to those who helped.
