      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Families Competition</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The results of this are arrived at by accumulating 
      the percentage of each participant’s time relative to the par time for 
      their course, so the lowest total wins. There were two entrants this year 
      and the results were as follows:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Chapman/Hooper (SO)&nbsp; 333.76</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Andrews (CROC)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      369.93</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planner's Report</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Planning an orienteering event, like life, is about 
      compromises.&nbsp; Because I have no motorised transport, the area I could 
      manage was limited, so Colley Hill was out.&nbsp; I had also wanted to minimise 
      the need for runs across the large open area towards the north of the 
      map.&nbsp; But the fact that this was a December event, with uncertain weather, 
      suggested the need for start and finish to be close to the parking and the 
      pavilion.&nbsp; The terrain itself is also patchy: densely intricate earth 
      features in parts, surrounded by wide, fast expanses, with many fewer 
      usable features.&nbsp; I hope the compromises worked.&nbsp; There didn’t seem to be 
      too many critical comments, although control 187 (the bracken-surrounded 
      pit on Blue and Brown) was mentioned frequently.&nbsp; It had apparently been 
      used, and caused problems, at the previous event here.&nbsp; Apologies to any 
      who thought it unfair; and also for having left out some tapes on similar 
      features in the same area which were not used.&nbsp; Despite those, and any 
      other glitches, I hope that you enjoyed your runs.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I wish to thank all those who helped make sure the 
      planner’s tasks were fulfilled, in particular control putter-outers and 
      collector-inners.&nbsp; Special thanks go to Chris McDonald, who acted as 
      mentor and my good conscience throughout the duration of the planning 
      period; to Philip Gristwood, who stepped in as controller at the last 
      minute and also made the maps happen; and to Simon Ling, who realised that 
      carrying large quantities of kit by bike can be difficult, and took charge 
      of planner’s logistics, in addition to everything else he had to do in his 
      double-header over the weekend.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Organiser's report</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It was far from certain these events would actually 
      take place until fairly recently mainly because of the lack of a 
      controller and also because of difficulty in obtaining permission for the 
      use of the Cricket Club Pavilion.&nbsp; However it all turned out all right in 
      the end, although the lack of advance publicity was probably responsible 
      for the relatively low numbers of competitors.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I would like to give special thanks to Philip 
      Gristwood for controlling so cheerfully and helpfully, as well as printing 
      all the maps for us, especially as he had only recently completed a major 
      planning task at Ash Ranges.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Thanks also to Graham Sutton for planning the 
      District event despite not having a car, and Mark Cheeseman the night 
      event despite not being available on that day due to work commitments.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;At least the weather was kind and the Common looked 
      spectacular in the low mist, so I hope you all enjoyed yourselves.&nbsp; 
      Congratulations to Mike Murray and Jackie Chapman, both of SLOW, who are 
      the new South East veterans champions; and to the Chapman family of SO who 
      won a close families competition.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Simon Ling<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Controller's 
      Report</b><div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Having volunteered to assist by controlling our own pair of events less 
        than 2 weeks before they took place did not give any opportunity for 
        pre-checking control sites, or making any significant alterations to 
        courses.&nbsp; To make things more interesting the SENiLe had only been 
        planned on paper and the planner was unable to visit Banstead again, 
        even for the event.&nbsp; Luckily I have run on Banstead a few times over the 
        years and I had actually planned a score event there in 1991, my second 
        go at planning, so visualisation was not a problem.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        As well as armchair checking the courses I also let myself in for 
        OCadding the night course so you could all have pre-printed maps.&nbsp; There 
        were a few minor tweaks and I would like to think a number of 
        improvements made to control descriptions and circle and line placing 
        and cutting.&nbsp; Although I had not planned to actually check the controls, 
        I later decided that I could find time&nbsp;to do it.&nbsp; I checked all 32 night 
        controls (Mark had been very generous and had completely different 
        controls for all the courses!) and all 43 day controls before each event 
        started, running a total distance of 21 km.&nbsp; Saturday was a bit 
        miserable with rain at times, but Sunday morning was bright and frosty 
        with a few deer around and was great.</div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        Luckily Mark and Graham had got things pretty well right and only 2 or 3 
        controls needed to be repositioned a little, most of you seemed to find 
        the correct ones.&nbsp; The night courses were a little on the easy side and 
        this was reflected in generally fast times.&nbsp; Had it been foggy like our 
        last SENiLe there it would have been a different matter.&nbsp; Sundays 
        courses seemed to be just right looking at the results.&nbsp; Times on Blue 
        were very fast but this was probably due to all the fast Vets having to 
        run it instead of Brown.</div>
