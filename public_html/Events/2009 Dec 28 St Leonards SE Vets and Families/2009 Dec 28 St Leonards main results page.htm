      <p>&nbsp;<p><a name="Planners Report"></a><b>Planner's Report<br>
      </b>Most of the taping took place in the rain where tracks, paths and 
      rides bore a remarkable resemblance to the streams and rivers. Some of the 
      final checking involved a trudge through the snow to remove a couple of 
      spare tapes in order to avoid competitor confusion. The event saw 
      sunshine, albeit a bit frosty, and relatively dry conditions underfoot.<p>
      Apologies for the late arrival of the loose control descriptions at 
      registration.<p>As Vince has commented, the area around 227 had been 
      chewed up by recent forestry work and although there was a note at the 
      start it can be difficult to remember these things after 60-90 minutes of 
      physical and mental effort. I frequently fail to remember similar notes 
      until after making a mistake, finishing and in later analysis thinking 
      &quot;isn't that where the map correction was - oh that explains everything!&quot; 
      Although I should have extended the extraction ride/track further east I 
      don't believe it would have assisted most runners.<p>In the planning of 
      the technical courses I tried to offer a mix of route choice and technical 
      navigation. If you think that your course offered little route choice then 
      you may want to view some of the routes already on the
      <a href="http://www.mvoc.routegadget.co.uk/cgi-bin/reitti.cgi">Routegadget</a> 
      page (and add your own). I think there may be some that neither Vince nor 
      I anticipated.<p>Mike Elliot, MV<p>&nbsp;<p><a name="Organisers Report"></a><b>Organiser's Report<br>
      </b>Getting someone as disorganised as me to organise anything is always a 
      bit dicey, especially when I have an overseas holiday shortly before the 
      event. However Moles and others rallied round, and largely sorted out what 
      needed doing without me telling them. Many thanks to them all.</p>
      <p>Having an indoor event centre with a hard-standing car park is a great 
      advantage, both simplifying the organisation and providing a better 
      service. Although it looked for a while as if the heating, and with it the 
      promise of hot showers, was going to be unavailable, fortunately the gas 
      man had it sorted before anyone finished.</p>
      <p>The downside of good facilities is often a long walk to the start. On 
      this occasion, the combination of my desire to keep you off the sloping 
      bendy bit of road and the need for a safe stream crossing without going 
      deep into the forest produced a route which was in places 'interesting'. I 
      nearly gave up and sent you all the way along the road; just as well I 
      persevered as water running over the road froze overnight, and cars were 
      sliding around - walking the road between the finish and the start would 
      have been seriously dangerous.</p>
      <p>Thanks to everyone who came, and look forwards to seeing you again at 
      our Regional event on 17th January - please enter by 10th January if 
      possible.</p>
      <p>Ian Ditchfield, MVOC</p>

      <p><b><a name="Controllers Report"></a>Controller's Report<br>
      </b>I had several pleasant visits to St Leonards, one of which was in 
      4-inches of snow, however this was replaced on the day by the more 
      familiar mud and the going was pretty tough in places. Mike's courses were 
      designed to test both your navigational skills and also your endurance, 
      especially on the Black and Brown courses. </p>
      <p>The comments at the finish were mostly favourable, but one control 
      which caused problems was 227, marsh, eastern edge, the last control on 
      all of the technically difficult courses. There was some recent forestry 
      work in this area (which Mike had warned you of), but also what appeared to be 
      other marshy areas possibly due to the wet conditions which helped confuse 
      tired runners.</p>
      <p>I thought that the car park and rugby club facilities were excellent 
      and as advertised Mole Valley produced a 'quality' event. Well done to Mike 
      and Ian and all the helpers.</p>
