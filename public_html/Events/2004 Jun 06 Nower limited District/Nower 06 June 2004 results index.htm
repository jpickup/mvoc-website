        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The Nower has everything, nice 
        runnable woodland, a good path network, lots of interesting pits, 
        gullies, depressions etc and a pretty hefty hill. The only problem is 
        that there is not enough of it, although this does mean it is a lot 
        quicker for planners and controllers to get round all the controls.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The size was no problem for the 
        yellow course, in fact it is ideally suited. That applies to the orange 
        as well although it did have to cross the road which I would have 
        preferred to avoid. The real challenge was to plan a reasonable green 
        course, which had to zig zag back and forth crossing itself several 
        times to get even a modest 4.2km. Without SI dibbers it would have 
        needed two master maps. However I hope it provided some challenges to 
        the punters, and even if the controls were easy enough to find, the 190 
        metre climb should have got you at least a little puffed!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As an absentee planner - I 
        planned the courses but was not able to be at the event - I cannot say 
        how this has worked out in practice. All I can say is that I found it 
        great fun to plan, I am sorry I was not there and I hope you all had a 
        satisfying run. My hearty thanks to Simon for agreeing to put out the 
        controls on the day. </span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I trust that you all enjoyed the 
        annual visit to The Nower, as in recent years the weather was hot and 
        dry on the day.&nbsp; The organisation seemed to run smoothly, and 
        surprisingly the parking did not run out, so thanks to those of you that 
        heeded the advice to share cars.&nbsp; My thanks also go to all the MV 
        helpers who performed their tasks efficiently and with the minimum of 
        fuss.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The maps that you had were not 
        up to the standard that they should have been and for that I apologise.&nbsp; 
        In the week preceding the event the blank copies of the maps were not 
        accessible, and therefore we ended up colour photocopying the master 
        maps.&nbsp; This did have the advantage that you had pre-marked maps, but the 
        quality was not great – particularly the light green screens, and the 
        amount of ‘cracking’ that occurred, I have learnt to be more careful 
        next time! I hope this did not spoil your enjoyment of the event too 
        much.</span></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As Bill was unable to be 
          present at the event although he did the intellectual part of the 
          planning before hand, it fell to me to hang the controls on the day.&nbsp; 
          I’d like to thank Ian and Nick who helped, and also Michael, Chris and 
          Ian who collected them in afterwards.</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The main problems on the day 
          were probably the fact that the last control on the green had slipped 
          off the control descriptions somehow, and that control 202 on the 
          yellow and orange did not work initially and had to be replaced.&nbsp; We 
          have not disqualified anybody who was affected by either of these 
          difficulties. </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Bill’s courses seemed to be 
          well received although the green turned out to be fairly strenuous 
          despite his worry that it wasn’t long enough! The fact that the 
          bracken had grown three feet since the course was planned probably had 
          quite a bit to do with that.&nbsp; Also the weather was rather too warm for 
          running in although very pleasant for sitting and watching!</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Thank you to everybody who 
          came – you made it all worth while.</span></p>
