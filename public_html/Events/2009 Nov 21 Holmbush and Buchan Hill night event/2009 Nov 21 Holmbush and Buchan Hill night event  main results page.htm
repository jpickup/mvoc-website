      NB We apologise for the problems with the map experienced at this event. 
      By way of a small compensation, anyone producing their illegible map at 
      our next event at St Leonards on 28 December will be given a free entry. </p>

      <p><b>Controller's comments</b><p>This event was always going to be a good 
      test of your night orienteering skills, but the slowly disappearing print 
      was not part of the plan. I was amazed at how well many of you coped with 
      this problem and how restrained you were with your comments. <p>We have 
      not disqualified people who could not find controls that had been rubbed 
      off their map, however at least one person was honest enough to admit that 
      the control they missed was still clearly visible on their map.<p>I think 
      the problem was partly caused by not covering the maps in the start lane 
      which meant that you started with a map that was already soaked.<p>Despite 
      this problem and the rain some of you even said you enjoyed the courses so 
      it is a shame that Ian's good work with the planning could not be fully 
      appreciated.<p>I was interested to see how you coped with the paintball 
      area and all of the unmapped 'junk' which added a bit of interest.<p>By 
      way of compensation I think MV are considering offering free runs at their 
      St Leonards event (28 December) to those who felt that their runs were 
      spoilt by the print problem.<p>Vince Joyce<br>
      SO<p><b>Planner's comments</b><p>This event was a return to tradition in 
      two ways. Firstly, it revived the old Mole tradition of heavy rain. At one 
      time the club's unofficial motto was 'pluvium ad infinitum'.<p>Secondly it 
      was a night event with cross country courses in the mould of the old 
      SENiLE (South East Night League). This used to have three courses, Navy 
      (night Blue), Olive (night Light Green) and Ochre (Night Yellow/Orange). 
      For good measure I threw in a Bottle (Night Green) course too, which was 
      just a truncated version of the Navy.<p>No apologies for the Navy and 
      Bottle being technically tough. This event was billed as being a practice 
      for a night championship. The Olive was a throwback to the original Light 
      Green specification, starting easy and getting harder later. It was 
      planned to force you off paths while using control sites close to major 
      relocation features - but relocation is never easy in the dark.<p>Use of 
      Mole Valley's stock of reflective kites has been controversial in the 
      past, with some claiming it makes finding the controls too easy. Tonight I 
      only used these kites on the Ochre course. This is intended for night 
      novices, and can never be too easy. I nearly used reflective kites on the 
      Olive too, but in the end didn't because several Olive controls were 
      shared with the Navy.<p>The massive disappointment of the night was the 
      failure of the ink to adhere to the map, causing difficult for many and 
      making continuing a total impossibility for some. <p>The hardest control 
      was probably 210 on the Navy course, the deciduous tree in the slow-run 
      conifer plantation. this required more precision than any other control, 
      and the ability to maintain a bearing through low-visibility forest while 
      dodging the trees. I think it was fair. It wasn't far from a track, and if 
      you weren't accurate enough to hit the tree, you should at least have been 
      able to find one of the clearings to the east and then take a few steps 
      west to the control. However this required map reading, and if by this 
      stage your map was no longer telling you that the western edge of the 
      plantation was fight, or that the clearings existed, then the control 
      would certainly have become unreasonable.<p>I would like to thank 
      everybody who ran for braving the weather and not moaning too much about 
      the maps. I would like also to thank all the other officials and helpers, 
      in particular the control collectors. When you've been standing around in 
      the wet for hours and just want to get home (or to the pub) it takes a 
      real star to go out into the forest again, so take a bow Caz, Paul, Nick 
      and Simon.<p>Ian Ditchfield<br>
