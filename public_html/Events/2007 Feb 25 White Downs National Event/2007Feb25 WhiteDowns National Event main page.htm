      <p><b><a name="Planner"></a>Planner's Report</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Let's get the abject apologies out of the way first! 
      We ran out of maps on course 3. It seems that the official responsible for 
      ordering, and checking, the maps, convinced himself that the M18L class 
      was on course 2. So we had too many maps for course 2 and not enough for 
      course 3. It shouldn't have happened, and we can only say sorry. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We “mugged” a few course 3 finishers to get a supply 
      of maps, so everyone who waited did get their run on course 3. However, 
      it's not the ideal preparation, being all psyched up for a start at one 
      time, and eventually going off an indeterminate time later. I hope it 
      didn't spoil your day.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We also had a shortage of maps on the Red course. 
      This course did have an adequate number of maps printed, so it seems that 
      some got lost somewhere, or possibly a group entering as one took a map 
      each. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">On the subject of maps, I think we have all learnt 
      today that waterproof maps are not mudproof. We did provide bags at the 
      start, so at least you had the option of taking one.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">One person on course 1 reported being challenged by 
      the gamekeeper while passing close to the out-of-bounds area. The 'keeper 
      had asked us to steer clear of his bird pen, hence the OOB, but it seems 
      that he has recently stocked a second pen of which I was not aware. Again, 
      I can only apologise, both to him and to you, and hope it didn't spoil 
      your run.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">My final apology is to the more frail people on the 
      Light Green course, who had trouble with control 235. I thought very 
      carefully about which classes should be expected to cope with steep 
      slopes. My error was to think only in terms of National Event classes, so 
      I was thinking about what a young and bouncy W14A could manage, completely 
      forgetting Light Green, which is the favoured course of people who for 
      whatever reason find even the 'S' course for their age too tough. Clearly 
      not good people to send up a muddy re-entrant on the side of a quarry. 
      Sorry!&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">A thought for the guideline writers, now that we have 
      M/W21V (V for Very Short) courses, perhaps we should also have a veteran V 
      class? This could run the same course as W75, in other words the shortest 
      and physically easiest of the technical courses. This course is about the 
      same length as W14A/W16B/Light Green, but (if the terrain permits TD5) 
      technically harder, and more obviously needs to be physically easy. My 
      guess is that many of the present Light Green customers would prefer such 
      a course; I may be wrong of course, what do the people who ran Light Green 
      think?&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Apart from the things which went wrong, it seemed 
      that most of it was OK. Scant consolation if you were one of those 
      affected by problems, I'm sure. Still many of you were kind enough to say 
      how much you enjoyed my courses.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I was brought up on the edge of White Downs, and used 
      to walk in the woods as a child. So I've been wanting to plan there since 
      I got into orienteering. Unfortunately, we were denied access to a central 
      part of the forest, due to felling operations which actually finished 
      three months ago. This blocked us off from the areas closest to my 
      childhood home.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">More importantly, it also prevented us from using the 
      bus stop in the middle of the area which was used for the 1999 National 
      Event. We had a long and fruitless search for a field in which we could 
      park you all adjacent to the map, followed by debates about exactly where 
      buses could get to and turn round. You have now visited the bus stop which 
      we eventually decided was the only practical option. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The drawback of this site is that it is on the fringe 
      of White Downs, indeed the previous round of mapping placed it on Ranmore 
      Common and not White Downs at all. It is linked to the main area by a 
      fairly narrow corridor of forest through which one would not ideally route 
      around 1,000 people in both directions.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">However, with the uncertainties that bussing 
      introduces into your arrival in time for your start, and the possibility 
      of seasonal weather, I thought a large shelter close to the start was 
      essential. Since a large shelter is difficult to carry, that meant start 
      close to the bus stop. I also hate a significant walk back to a bus stop; 
      queuing for the bus in the rain is bad enough when you're still warm from 
      your run; if you've had time to cool off, it's really unpleasant, even if 
      re-clad from the clothing dump. So, finish close to the bus stop too.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The good thing about starting in the east of the area 
      is that it permitted almost all courses to visit what I believe to be the 
      most pleasant bit of the forest, the “white” bluebell wood each side of 
      the north/south road. I tried to make as much use of this as possible.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">For the technical courses, my main aim was to keep 
      you off paths and tracks, while still providing some long legs with plenty 
      of route choice. Inevitably a track route must be an option on a long leg, 
      but I tried to make sure it was a slower one. Recent weather helped in 
      this, I think forest was much faster than quagmire today!&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">With both start and finish in a narrow corridor, and 
      another area being used as much as possible, parts of the forest saw a lot 
      of people. I tried to reduce processions by using relay-style “gaffling”, 
      so that if you got in with somebody on another course following broadly 
      the same route, at least you had to navigate to different control sites 
      occasionally.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We had some debate about course length. My original 
      target length was based on the results from the previous White Downs event 
      in 1999, but I felt the resulting courses were a little short. Controller 
      Dave however thought the lengths about right, so they stayed as they were. 
      We did agree that it is better to err on the short side in mid-winter.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Planning was just about complete when storms 
      flattened part of a plantation through which most courses passed on the 
      first or second leg. Had this been a few weeks earlier, we would have 
      moved the start or finish west of the windblow and made you suffer the 
      walk, but this would have meant substantial replanning of every course to 
      reinstate lost length. It was just too late to contemplate this, so I was 
      confined to re-jigging some of the early controls, and dropping one for 
      which the description changed from “clearing” to “pile of fallen trees, 
      middle”. I also sawed the tops&nbsp; (the trunk was too thick further down) off 
      some of the trees which had fallen over the track to the the south of the 
      plantation so that you could squeeze by.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Many people deserve my, and your, thanks, including 
      Michael White for coping with every problem thrown his way; Mike Elliot 
      for producing an excellent map; and Dave Stubbs for his helpful 
      suggestions, and patience in the face of a succession of missed deadlines. 
      And many others, apologies for not attempting to list you all here.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Most of all, I would like to thank the competitors. I 
      do enjoy planning, but it would be rather pointless if nobody ran the 
      courses. I'd like to know where you went, please use the Route Gadget link 
      from the event results page.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Right, got that out of the way, time to pick up on 
      the backlog of outstanding things from “normal” life – Oh drat, just 
      remembered that in a moment of weakness I agreed to plan a street-O in 
      March....</p>

      large number of people efficiently and safely. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Thank you to the landowners for allowing us to use 
      their land – Wotton Estate, the National Trust, the Forestry Commission 
      and Tilhill Forestry Ltd. Thank you to Jim Storrar of Wotton Estate, Rob 
      Hewer of the National Trust and Nick Rudley of Tilhill Forestry. And 
      thanks also to Friends Provident for allowing us to use their facilities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Thank you to Countryliner for providing an efficient 
      bus service. To Adrian Moir for the internet entry system which worked 
      well. 90% of the entries by internet. To Judith Powell for drawing up the 
      start list and making last minute changes efficiently. To the members of 
      the Dorking Division of the St John Ambulance Service who voluntarily gave 
      up their Sunday to assist us.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Finally a big thank you to Mike Elliot for drawing an 
      excellent new map for which many appreciative comments were received. </p>

      <p><b><a name="Controller"></a>Controller's Report</b></p>
      <p>Firstly, the planner Ian Ditchfield was very organised and gave me 
      little to do except check sites in the wood. I thought he used the terrain 
      well and planned excellent courses. The times, in general, were as 
      expected, including M21L which at 66 minutes was quicker than the 
      guidelines and showed that the course could have been 1km longer. However, 
      due to possible adverse weather, the course was kept on the shorter side.</p>
      <p>The organisation was slick and Michael White had already set in motion 
      everything I was concerned about before I asked the question. Well done 
      Michael and all of Mole Valley.</p>
      <p>Although very late, I felt the map in general was excellent and 
      represented the terrain well. However it was still affected by ongoing 
      forestry work and January gales in some areas. Hopefully this did not 
      significantly affect competitors' enjoyment of the area.</p>
      <p>I must thank Katy for giving up her run and assisting prior to and 
      during the weekend.</p>
