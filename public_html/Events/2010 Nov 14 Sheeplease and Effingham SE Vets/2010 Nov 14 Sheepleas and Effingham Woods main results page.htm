      <p>&nbsp;<p><b>Planner's Report</b><p>Thanks to all those who took part 
      over the weekend and made it all worthwhile. <br>
      <br>
      For the night event Sheepleas on its own provided a compact runnable area 
      and two laps were needed to get a Navy course of around 6km. The Olive was 
      also planned as the night variant of the Green course and was thus as 
      difficult as I could reasonably make it; the results suggest it was on the 
      hard side and with hindsight I would pitch it closer to Light Green in 
      standard. One pair gave us some anxious moments when they went off the map 
      and detoured via East Horsley and the A246. <br>
      <br>
      Sunday’s courses were only finalised quite late on because of the 
      uncertainty over securing suitable parking and I hope that the planning 
      didn’t suffer too much as a result. It did mean almost all of the night-O 
      controls were re-used and perhaps some control placements were better for 
      one event than the other.<br>
      <br>
      I had initially hoped to use Oldlands, the area east of the Dorking Road, 
      but some access issues and severe undergrowth led me to discard the idea. 
      This limited the longer courses to a circuit of Dick Focks Common 
      (Effingham Woods), where the brambles and brashings make for hard-going 
      and the rhododendrons seem to get thicker year by year. Without being 
      unduly repetitive on Sheepleas the Brown course was on the short side, 
      although a sub-50 minute winning time is a fine performance. At the other 
      end of the scale the multitude of paths on Sheepleas resulted in the White 
      course being more difficult than it should have been.<br>
      <br>
      My thanks go to Philip Gristwood for taking on the controller’s role for 
      both events at short notice and doing a very thorough job in the limited 
      time available, to Ted McDonald in particular for negotiating the parking 
      arrangements that allowed us to put Sunday’s event on, and to all those 
      Moles who helped put out and collect in the controls.<br>
      <br>
      We were slightly over-subscribed on the Blue and Green courses so thanks 
      also go to all those who allowed their maps to be recycled. We have some 
      details of people who requested a replacement map; if you would like to be 
      added to the list please email us by the end of the week at infoATmvoc.org 
      (replacing ‘AT’ with @).<br>
      <br>
      Nick Green, MV<p><b>Organiser's Report</b><p>We expected small numbers of 
      devotees for the Night event and therefore this required only minimal 
      organisation and four helpers apart from officials. <p>For the Sunday 
      event parking was the main issue. Fields near Sheepleas were not an option 
      as local landowners said their land is far too slippery when wet. Bussing 
      had been used for an earlier National Event but was considered too 
      expensive for this smaller Regional Event. <p>We were able to go ahead 
      only due to the willingness of several businesses in East Horsley but on 
      the day this worked very well. We are very grateful to the owners of the 
      St Martin’s Business Centre, the Nomad Theatre, The De Vere Conference 
      Centre, and the Ramada Hotel for parking permissions, and to The Duke of 
      Wellington pub and the Total petrol station for use of their toilets. In 
      gratitude we have made donations to their elected charities including 
      Pancreatic Cancer, Oxfam, Variety Club and the British Legion Poppy 
      Appeal.<p>Many thanks to MV helpers for turning out in force and to all 
      runners for coming along and making it so worthwhile.<p>Ted McDonald, MV<p><b>Controller's Report</b><p>I was asked to take on 
      controlling the day and night events at very short notice when the club 
      had found it impossible to find an outside controller despite asking 28 
      people. There is clearly a demand for some more people to train as 
      controllers, and it is quite an enjoyable task as you get out into the 
      woods when there is no-one else there, and can pick a time when it is not 
      raining.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the very short timescale, and the fact I was already controlling 
      another event the following week, it was difficult to give as much input 
      as I would have hoped. Nevertheless checking was done very thoroughly 
      despite there being many controls spread over a wide area, and I was 
      unaware of any complaints. I apologise for delaying starts a little on 
      Sunday but there were 2 failed control units which we managed to get 
      replaced before you went out.<br>
      <br>
      Except as Nick has mentioned the course lengths seemed to be about right. 
      The very fast winning times on the Blue and Green courses were due to 
      people competing in prescribed courses for the various competitions, who 
      would normally have run on longer courses.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to Ted for doing a great job finding sufficient car parking near 
      registration and to Nick for planning a range of courses which most people 
      seemed to enjoy, and of course to all of the Mole helpers who were 
      involved at the 2 events. It was just a pity that it started raining as 
      the first people started.<p>Philip Gristwood, MV<p>&nbsp;</td>
