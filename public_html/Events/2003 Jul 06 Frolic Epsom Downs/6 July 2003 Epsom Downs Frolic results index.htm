        <div>
          Many years ago this was where I had my first experience of planning
          for MVs picnic event.&nbsp; As I recall the undergrowth was much less
          then and most controls were in the woods rather than in the open.&nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          Now the opposite is the case and the area is just about OK for a
          FROLIC type event.&nbsp; With the limitations of racetrack and
          overgrown woods it is now very difficult to plan interesting courses
          for Yellow and Orange.&nbsp; With a few helpful suggestions from Tim
          Denton (controller) I think we got some reasonable courses and so I
          hope you all had an enjoyable run.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          Despite having an updated map there were a few inaccuracies which
          caused problems for a few people in finding a knoll on the Light Green
          course.&nbsp; It was also pointed out that perhaps the North lines had
          not been updated since 1988, so I hope these did not cause too much
          inconvenience.
        </div>
        <div>

        <div>
          My thanks go to Tim for not only controlling but also putting out half
          the controls - ensuring that no-one else lost a competitive run - and
          also helping to collect them in again.

        was a near perfect day for a frolic on Epsom Downs, perhaps a little too

        the General Public who tolerated the antics of strangely clad orienteers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        start, and who had a bit of a wait while we got the SI equipment up and
        running. Once the initial queue worked its way through the start there
        was a steady stream of competitors on each course, and I hope you all
        enjoyed your courses once you got going.</span>

            Epson Downs is not the most technical of areas.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
            Philip did well to put together a set of courses with some technical
            and physical challenges for the more experienced, and variety on the
            yellow and orange.
          </div>
          &nbsp;
          <div>
            As noted elsewhere, there were some oddities on the map, and Philip
            tried to plan around these.&nbsp; The knoll at No 5 on the Frolics
            course was used despite knowing that it was mapped a little west of
            it's true location - something to correct for the next print of the
            map.
