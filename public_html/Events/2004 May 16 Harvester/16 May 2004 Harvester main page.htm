        <b><a name="Planners comments"></a>Planner's comments</b><br>
&nbsp;I hope you all enjoyed running the courses as much as I enjoyed planning 
        them. I think Pippingford Park is the best night area in the South-East, 
        so I would have failed badly if you didn't, especially with such 
        glorious weather.<br>
        <br>
        I had two particular objectives in mind. One was to produce courses 
        that, while possibly strenuous, were not physically unpleasant. I have 
        run too many courses in recent years from which the abiding memory has 
        been brambles, brashings, or some similar nasties. The only real problem 
        of this nature on Pippingford is the heathland on the far side of the 
        valley from assembly, which I thought might be too tough for those 
        running the shorter courses. For this reason, I gave the &quot;5km&quot; laps a 
        long leg through this area, permitting path or track routes.<br>
        <br>
        The other objective was, while providing as much head-to-head racing as 
        possible, to preserve the requirement to navigate rather than follow. In 
        particular, I was determined to gaffle the last lap on the &quot;A&quot; course. 
        This causes some difficulty, as there is only one &quot;12km&quot; lap, and the 
        rules require that each team must collectively have run exactly the same 
        legs by the end of the course. Thus gaffling the &quot;12km&quot; lap means mixing 
        legs and gaffles with another lap, in this case the &quot;9km&quot; lap.</div>
      <div>
        <br>
        I would urge anyone planning a relay to think about gaffling from the 
        outset. I left the gaffling to the last minute, having previously 
        identified and taped pairs of control sites. This was fine for the &quot;5km&quot; 
        and &quot;7km&quot; laps, which each team ran twice. For the &quot;9km&quot; and &quot;12km&quot; 
        laps, it would have been a lot easier to have a choice of three splits 
        for each gaffle. Having only two meant a 2/3rds, 1/3rds split at each 
        gaffle instead of a 50/50 split. Thus different gaffle combinations 
        occurred with different frequency, and made working out the number of 
        maps for each variation unnecessarily complicated.<br>
        <br>
        I would particularly like to thank Keith Tonkin (controller), Michael 
        Napier (map labels and SI processing) and Alan Halliday (map printing) 
        for coping with my rather late-running planning process. It turned out 
        to be just as well that we were behind, as a final site visit seven days 
        before the event, which was supposed just to be agreeing the 
        start/finish layout, discovered that a stile intended as the second 
        fence crossing point for the longer courses had metamorphosed into an 
        8ft-high fence. Making substantial changes to courses six days before a 
        major event is not recommended by stress councillors, but we seem to 
        have got away with it!<br>
&nbsp;</div>

        Thank you all for coming,<br>

      <span lang="EN-GB">Thanks to all those who came to the event, I hope you 
      all enjoyed the area and the race.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Ian, Keith and myself wanted to 
      make the event as spectator friendly as possible and the terrain helped in 
      this. The use of the radio (and wired) control units, supplied by Ian and 
      Jon Marsden (HH), and Michael Napier's associated “Ocomm” software, enabled us to set 
      up the changeover tent as we did.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Keith Tonkin supplied the 
      projector for the penultimate control display, thus eliminating the need 
      for the writing of the numbers of the incoming runners on a large board. 
      Of course provision was made for bad weather display, there were 3 more 
      tents available to hold the projector, screen and computers, but these 
      proved unnecessary.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Thanks to Michael Napier (NOC) 
      for providing the entry and results processing service, being able to 
      leave everything in his capable hands removed one of the organiser’s 
      points of concern almost completely.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My apologies for the siting of the 
      Portaloo units, they arrived before anticipated and were sited by the 
      contractors at the point I expected to meet them. Had I been on site there 
      would then have been 3 near to the camping area, 2 at the Hut and 1 closer 
      to the changeover area.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The biggest problems on the day 
      (night) were caused by outgoing runners not knowing which lap of which 
      team they were running, despite the information being on the bib they had 
      on their chest. This resulted in three teams being disqualified (it would 
      have been 4 but the 3 lap of the short race was the same for all teams). 
      The problems it caused to the other teams and the organising team were 
      even greater and had the Clyde team been fully competitive may have 
      affected the result. There had been a lot of discussion about whether the 
      incoming or the outgoing runner should collect the map from the tree. I 
      opted for the outgoing runner on the grounds that they would be less tired 
      and know the lap they were running, but is seems that I was wrong, in four 
      cases.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My thanks to all those Moles who 
      helped throughout Saturday and Sunday as well as fitting in a run and 
      particularly to Helen and Jackie for sorting out the prize winners so 
      efficiently.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For those of you disturbed by the 
      grunting and snuffling noises below the campsite, it was the badgers what 
      did it!!</span></p>

      <p><b><a name="Controllers comments"></a>Controller's 
      comments</b><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Pippingford Park 
      offers quite a number of different terrain types within a small area. The 
      courses were planned to try and offer elements of most of this variety to 
      competitors. We felt that the area was going to be quick and being early 
      enough in the season would avoid difficult bracken. By bringing all 
      courses over 7km through the assembly area we were increasing running 
      speeds as the grasslands offered little physical resistance and lower 
      technical challenge. I test ran an early form of the 7km course at (my) 
      full speed in the day and ran all the moorland sections in the dark on the 
      same routes I expected competitors to take. From this and past results we 
      estimated the overall course lengths. For the A course at night we were 
      aiming at around 7.5 minute kilometres and in the day 6. Early in the race 
      I was getting a little nervous that this may have been pessimistic as 
      despite the course climb the first few teams were slightly faster than 
      this. Thankfully the mist came and added a little more technical 
      difficulty to the moorland slope in Pippingford and the lower sections of 
      Ashdown. Some competitors came back to say the mist was patchy but in 
      places visibility was extremely short. Overall average speeds of just 
      under 7 minutes for the winners of A and 9.5 for B seem fairly reasonable.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The changeover location offered 
      great views over the far side of the valley and it was expected that 
      spectators may see more at night than in the day. The early gaffling on 
      courses meant that spectators saw lights changing direction and crossing 
      over as teams progressed through the first 2km or so to the radio control 
      on the far hillside. To add further interest we also included a 
      pre-spectator control radio alert and placed the control right next to the 
      changeover area. Both planner and organiser felt that the event should be 
      involving and that we offer something to the rest of the team when they 
      were not running. After all The Harvester is a team race. I think they 
      largely succeeded and hopefully have contributed to the great experience 
      the Harvester should be. Of course we were blessed with excellent weather 
      which meant that staying up all night, and being outside, really wasn’t a 
      problem.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A lot of checking went into making 
      sure we were thorough. However, whether you are a planner or controller 
      you do sometimes have some self doubt as competitors are going out that 
      something just may be wrong. Little things can suddenly be magnified into 
      something huge. No doubt there are tales of woe from the event, but also 
      many tales of success. Looking through the results there appears to be 
      more of the latter than the former which is a relief to say the least.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I would like to thank Mole Valley 
      on your behalf for a great event. Congratulations to the trophy winners. 
      Celebrate your success and bring the trophies back next year to try and 
      defend them.</span></p>
