      <td width="100%"><b>Access</b><br>
      Pippingford Park is a turning off the main A22 London-Eastbourne trunk 
      road. Easy access from the motorway network, either M25 junction 6 or M23 
      junction 10. East Grinstead railway station is about 6 miles away. Teams 
      from the more distant parts of the country should note that Gatwick 
      Airport is only 15 miles away. The taxi firm on the Gatwick Airport web 
      site (unlikely to be the cheapest) quoted £32 for a pre-booked car capable 
      of taking four people plus baggage from the airport to Pippingford.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Terrain</b><br>
      Pippingford Park is a private estate formed by enclosing part of Ashdown 
      Forest, which is part of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural 
      Beauty. The area is bisected by a string of lakes along Steel Forge 
      Stream, which is famous for Pooh Sticks Bridge (unfortunately outside 
      Pippingford) and is a tributary of the River Medway. Most of the park 
      slopes down to the stream; the height difference between the highest and 
      lowest parts of the map is over 100m. <br>
      <br>
      Pippingford is now an army training area, although privately owned. Live 
      munitions are not used, so there should be no risk from &quot;suspicious 
      objects&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      The park is also used intensively by fallow deer. These spend the night on 
      Ashdown Forest proper, and migrate into Pippingford for the day, 
      preferring the company of the army to that of the general public and their 
      dogs.<br>
      <br>
      Three sorts of terrain predominate. The area around the start &amp; finish is 
      abandoned grazing that is now kept mown by the deer. Very fast, but not 
      very technical.<br>
      <br>
      There is a lot of semi-natural woodland, mostly deciduous. Oak is 
      commonest, but most trees native to southern England can be found 
      somewhere. Most of the woodland is very runnable; the deer help by 
      trimming the lower foliage, and there is little green on the map. The 
      bluebells should be in full bloom at the time of the event.<br>
      <br>
      The third terrain type is open heath, with heather and long grass. Running 
      through this is moderately hard work, but Pippingford is too well drained 
      for the extensive areas of deep marsh and tussock grass for which Ashdown 
      Forest is notorious. Again, the deer help by creating lots of little 
      (unmapped) paths.<br>
      <br>
      The area is almost completely free of brambles and gorse, and the army 
      don't seem to have left any wire lying around. Two millennia of use for 
      iron working and military activities have left a wealth of earth features 
      to add to the natural re-entrants for control sites.<div>
        <br>
&nbsp;<b>Lap Lengths and Course Patterns</b><br>
        Please note that&nbsp;the Lap lengths are provisional and subject to test 
        running of the courses.&nbsp;The actual&nbsp;lengths will be adjusted following 
        test running with the aim&nbsp;of hitting the winning-time targets.
