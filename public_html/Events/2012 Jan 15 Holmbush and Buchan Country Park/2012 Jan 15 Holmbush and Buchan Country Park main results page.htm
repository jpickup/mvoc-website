      My apologies for the paintballing situation – it was never my intention 
      for any good route choices to use this area but I overlooked this on some 
      last minute changes to Blue and Short Blue (although, it should have been 
      OK anyway!).<p class="MsoNormal">Apart from that, I hope you all enjoyed 
      your courses and the area, which continues to become less green with 
      on-going rhody clearance work in the North West part of the map (which is 
      why this bit wasn’t used).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Course lengths seem to have been OK – I doubt if many 
      finishers were wishing for a few more controls!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Thanks to Mike Elliot and Vince, without whom there 
      would have been a lot more talking points! - And Mike Bolton for his calm 
      and helpful organising - and my helpers on the day.</p>

      <p><b>Organiser's Comments<br>
      </b>Plan A – at the end of August 2011 I was asked if I would like to 
      organise a Level B Event on South Ashdown on January 15th 2012. Great, I 
      thought – it’s about the nearest Mole territory to where I live (Brighton, 
      but once a Mole always a Mole) and I would be making regular visits to 
      Forest Row whilst my wife was following a counselling training based there 
      – perfect...or so I thought?<p>Plan B – come the beginning of October, I 
      had done little more than show an interest in parking at Crowborough Camp, 
      when the venue was changed to Ashtead and Epsom Commons. Hmm – not quite 
      so close to Brighton then(!) but what the heck? The land owners of the 
      commons were welcoming, Ashtead Station Car Park was available to anyone 
      for the price of £1 per car and the local Scout Hut would be ideal as an 
      Event Centre, complete with loos and keen youthful caterers. By the end of 
      November, Keith had planned the courses and all seemed to be coming along 
      nicely when Natural England pulled the plug on the land permissions. Hmm – 
      6 weeks to go and the Christmas/New Year holidays looming....that’s that 
      then?<p>Plan C – the MV committee were not to be beaten and mid-December 
      they settled on Holmbush and Buchan as their preferred option for a Level 
      C replacement. Just two problems, I was v busy clearing the decks ready to 
      go away for the holiday, therefore unavailable until after Christmas, and 
      our original Controller was also going to be away at the crucial time. 
      Over the hill came the cavalry in the shape of Mike Elliot and Vince 
      Joyce. Mike sorted out land permissions in a matter of days and Vince 
      agreed to take over as controller (and of course Keith had to set about 
      designing a completely new set of courses!).<p>On the day we were 
      bamboozled by the appearance of paintballers in an area they had told us 
      they would not be using this Sunday. A lack of communication between those 
      running the paintball would seem to be the cause. Our apologies to any and 
      all that were affected by unfortunate circumstances beyond our control.<p>
      My particular thanks to Harry Calvert – the manager of the Holmbush Estate 
      – for making the organisation of this event so straightforward. The use of 
      a heated building and the Farm Park Car Park solved all the logistical 
      problems at a stroke. All I had to do then was book a few loos and 
      allocate jobs to the willing Mole helpers.<p>Thanks to Vince for his 
      supportive controlling and to Keith for the planning, and then planning 
      again, and then planning again, and then..... And thanks of course to the 
      many Mole helpers (and a couple of Southdowners who also lent a hand) who 
      made it all happen. <p>Finally, thanks to you for coming and making all 
      the effort of organising worthwhile. The playground was a definite hit 
      with the youngsters and it was really nice out in the forest. I hope that 
      you were able to take away some good memories of the day.<p>Mike Bolton (aka 
      Boltmole),
      MV<p><b>Controller's Comments</b><p>Keith planned some good challenging 
      courses which needed very little input from me as controller. <p>I must 
      apologise to competitors who found themselves in the middle of a paintball 
      battle. The paintball organiser had reassured us that there were no games 
      planned for the southern area and although there were no controls within 
      the ‘war zone’ on some courses there were possible route choices through 
      it. With hindsight I should have insisted on marking the whole area as out 
      of bounds. <p>Some competitors found the rhododendrons difficult to 
      negotiate, sadly only the longer courses got to run in Buchan Country Park 
      which is so much more runnable than Holmbush. <p>Thanks to Mike Bolton for 
      organising his small band of helpers so efficiently. <p>Vince Joyce,
      SO</td>
