      <p><b>Planner's Report</b></p>
      <p>Thanks to the few of you who came and made the effort worthwhile - it 
      was a shame that the rain deterred the rest. Holmbush is an interesting, 
      attractive and varied forest and I hope you all enjoyed finding new bits 
      of it. We have never used that particular start location before, nor the 
      areas to the West of the road.</p>
      <p>I like score events, and they pose different challenges to the planner 
      as well as the competitor. My belief is that the planner has succeeded if 
      every control is visited by at least one competitor, but nobody manages to 
      visit them all. This was the case at Holmbush, but I must admit that the 
      size and shape of the area was a great help. The main problem was the 
      restricted corridor South of the main out of bounds area (restricted due 
      to paintball games and Halloween events at the Farm). I would have liked 
      to have set up two obvious routes through it (in and out) but that was not 
      feasible.</p>
      <p>Most people seemed to have opted for the larger more open but remote 
      area to the East rather than closer but greener West of the road. 
      Certainly some of the thickets there could impede progress significantly 
      if less than close attention was paid to route choice. </p>
      <p>I hope you enjoyed the start location. The effect was much as I 
      expected - that is often several minutes studying options before setting 
      of down one of the five or six possible routes. I had not realised how 
      difficult it might be to pick up the start triangle on the map and future 
      planners might like to consider a pre-start map giving just that 
      information. One could also decide to give competitors the competition map 
      itself at -2 minutes. Would that be fair?</p>
      <p>The optimum route was, I think, quite difficult to spot. My version was 
      to start with 204, 232, 201, 202 and 203, then looping clockwise round the 
      Eastern section, crossing the road after 231 and back via 207 before 
      picking up the final four controls West of the finish. It measured at 
      10.6km - not feasible except to world class orienteers. I was glad Graham 
      Gristwood did not show up because with 36 controls the normal SI dibber is 
      not up to the task. Our winner, Who visited all controls East of the road 
      bar one, got quite close to the limit! Congratulations, Alan!</p>
      <p>Possibly the penalty regime is too harsh. It is clearly impossible to 
      pick up an extra control in less than one minute - even Alan averaged over 
      two minutes for each one; so perhaps 5 points per minute would be adequate 
      or perhaps 1 point per ten seconds. </p>
      <p>I would like to thank Vince the controller for his constructive and 
      helpful comments, Mike B for organising, Mike E for map updating printing 
      and computer wizardry, Tony for sorting out the land permissions, the 
      various landowners and users involved, including the paintballers for 
      courtesy and helpfulness, those who helped by setting out and collecting 
      in controls (you know who you are) and once again everybody who came.</p>
      <p>Simon Ling, MV<br>

      <b><br>
      Controller's Report<br>
      <br>
      </b>With an optimum route of 10.6km we were not expecting anybody to get 
      all of the controls and the initial route choice was made all the more 
      difficult by starting you on a ‘five way’ junction. </p>
      <p>I wonder how many of you chose your route based on the points values, 
      certainly the faster runners would automatically head for the twenty 
      pointers in Buchan Park but for most of you it would mean a quick bit of 
      mental arithmetic to work out if it was worth crossing the road to the 
      Scout Camp. </p>
      <p>Would your route have been different if all of the controls had the 
      same points?</span></p>Well done Simon for 
      planning an excellent event and to Mike for a very slick bit of 
      organising. </span><b></p>

      <p><b>Organiser's Report</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">My particular thanks to Harry Calvert – the manager 
      of the Holmbush Estate – for making such a wonderful assembly area/car 
      park, available to us. My visits to the site in the dry earlier in the 
      month gave me great hopes for a good event – unfortunately the weather had 
      other ideas.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The state of the Car Park on the day came as a bit of 
      a shock – it was perfect on Friday when the loos were delivered. Happily 
      you all managed to exit without getting stuck or slipping into the ditch!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It was a delight to be out and about on the estate in 
      the last few weeks – amazing fungi, marvellous autumn colours and stunning 
      views.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">The turnout was a bit disappointing and I thought it 
      must be down to the weather, but<i> </i>listening to some of you at the 
      finish it appears that Score events are not that popular either? <i>&nbsp;</i>I

      turned out to make it all happen. </p>
