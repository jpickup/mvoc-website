      to come the North East, and if only it had not rained buckets before dawn 
      the conditions might not have been quite as demanding as they were.&nbsp; I do 
      hope that the wind-chill effects have now worn off!&nbsp; When planning the 
      courses, I had anticipated this to some extent and gave route choice which 
      avoided the worst marshy bits, but some of the rides used on the short 
      courses were much wetter than I would have wished, and gave a “slide to 
      the control” option. </span>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The winning times were pretty much 
      as I had expected, and it was re-assuring that most competitors found all 
      of the controls to be in the right place. A few also discovered some 
      controls left out from the previous night event. None were in, or close 
      to, the control circle for the courses, and in any event had a completely 
      different control code range (200’s not100’s).&nbsp; Fortunately all controls 
      operated without failure and there was no vandalism – except for 236 at 
      the highest point on the Brown which was demolished (I suspect 
      accidentally by an over-enthusiastic competitor- but he or she should by 
      rights have been too tired after the climb up the hill!) and thanks to Ian 
      Ditchfield for retrieving the box from the depths of a very cold wet pit – 
      which had been dry the day before!&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">My thanks go to Mark Rowe and Bill 
      Alexander for giving me a hand in setting out the control boxes for the 
      short courses – as I managed to get my car stuck in the mud this turned 
      out to be beyond value – as was the help from Ian Ditchfield and 
      controller Andrew Evans who added two person-power to retrieve the 
      situation.&nbsp; Most embarrassing!! Control collection thanks are due to Ian, 
      Mark, Nigel (despite recovering from a particularly gruesome injury), and 
      Nick – they enabled all to leave before dark (for which I am particularly 
      grateful).</span></p>

      <td width="100%"><span lang="EN-GB">Sunday was a very cold day and a 
      strong wind across Ashdown Forest gave a substantial wind chill. 
      Fortunately we had the troop shelter to give tolerable conditions to the 
      computer and registration teams. It was nice to have a substantial parking 
      area although heavy overnight rain had made the grass soft. Not 
      surprisingly few competitors fancied the nearly frozen orange squash after 
      their run. Having a site that was easy to sign post, a start and finish 
      near the car park and fixed toilets made for a relatively easy job for the 
      organiser. A bifocal spectacle lens was found at control 10 on the blue 
      course, if the owner will contact me via the website then I will return 
      it.</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I would like to thank 
      all those Moles who helped at the event and the efficient way everybody 
      carried out their jobs. Thanks to Mike Elliot for obtaining permissions 
      from the various landowners and for running the electronics. And thanks to 
      Chris and his helpers for getting the controls up in plenty of time so we 
      could start early. And finally thanks to Andrew for controlling the event.</span></p>

      <td width="100%"><span lang="EN-GB">Pippingford has a lot of variety of 
      terrain and gives several opportunities for challenging courses. In 
      December, it was important to avoid the major river crossings as the water 
      level is variable; Chris’s courses did this. The sunshine welcoming the 
      early starters gave little indication of the heavy rain in the preceding 
      24 hours. I think this justified fully the approach Chris took. &nbsp;</span><p class="MsoNormal">
      <span lang="EN-GB">All the technically difficult courses included an 
      element of “real Ashdown”, the area to the east of the main river system 
      and some competitors found this tough going. It was meant to be! Chris’s 
      course lengths allowed for this and the winning times were as expected. &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The shorter courses were largely 
      on rides, more difficult to navigate along than a path system, but it was 
      pleasing to see that all competitors on white, yellow and orange completed 
      their course successfully. Although there were a few punching errors on 
      the more technical courses, each was at a completely different control 
      suggesting isolated misjudgements. &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Well done to Michael for his 
      coordination of the many Moles that helped on the day to make this a very 
      smooth running event. </span></p>
