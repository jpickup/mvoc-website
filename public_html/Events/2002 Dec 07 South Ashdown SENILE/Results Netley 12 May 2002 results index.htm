        <h3><a name="Planners report"></a>Planner’s report</h3>
        <p>Graham Gristwood originally planned courses for this event a year
        ago, but then along came Foot and Mouth and everything was shelved.&nbsp;
        A year on, exam commitments meant that he was unable to take on the role
        again, so, living close by, I was persuaded to take over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start and finish and the broad shape of the courses were all pretty
        much as Graham had intended them, but, for various reasons, I did have
        to re-plan the longer courses.&nbsp; Some control sites proved unusable,
        usually where the map was no longer representative of the terrain.&nbsp;
        This was exacerbated by forestry work in the northern part of the area,
        which should improve things considerably in years to come but made it
        difficult to find acceptable control sites on this occasion.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the notes on the day, the sawmill has extended its
        operations considerably.&nbsp; The huge stacks of timber flanking the
        track make it impractical to set legs cutting across this part of the
        area, which is a pity given some nice contour detail on the slope to the
        west.</p>
        <p>Finally, we only learnt of the clay pigeon shoot on the Wednesday
        prior to the event.&nbsp; Although there were no controls within the
        shooting area itself, this still meant a late night re-working the
        courses from red through to brown with controller Charlie Turner,
        without the time to make any further checks.&nbsp; We had to ditch one !
        control as being too close and we tried to lead you away from the option
        of cutting across the slope alongside the out-of-bounds (which would
        have made a nice run in towards the finish).&nbsp; As it was, the fall
        of shot went somewhat further than had been expected and Charlie stepped
        in to extend the tapes marking the out of bounds area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That's enough about the difficulties.&nbsp; For the most part
        planning was very enjoyable: for me this is probably the nicest part of
        the whole White Downs map and I tried to route you through the best
        bits.&nbsp; The leaves coming out in the fortnight before the event did
        reduce visibility, which probably slowed people down slightly and
        certainly made one or two controls less obvious (for instance the
        vegetation boundary at 207).&nbsp; There was also the strange experience
        of putting out the first SI boxes at 6.00am on the morning of the event
        and hearing a strange music reverberating over the forest, which turned
        out to be a rave on Ranmore Common - thank goodness we weren't running
        there!</p>
        <p>My thanks go to Charlie Turner for his advice, thoroughness and
        willingness to put in a lot of effort to ensure we met what became quite
        a tight timetable, especially with the last-minute complications of the
        clay shoot, to Graham Gristwood for his groundwork last year, to Mike
        Elliot, Keith Masson and Ian Ditchfield for control hanging and to the
        many who volunteered to collect in controls afterwards.</p>

<p>
With less than four weeks publicity for this event it was very pleasing to see
nearly 300 orienteers, ranging from the family who only came for the string
course to the strong contingent from the Swedish Army, enjoying the delights of
this well-hidden part of Surrey.&nbsp; (So well-hidden in fact that the St John
Ambulance volunteers never found it!)
</p>
<p>
It probably didn't bother the Swedes, but the sound of gunfire was a little
disconcerting for some competitors and I hope did not deter too much from your
enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
Our thanks are due to the Forestry Commission, Steve Taylor &amp; Neil Austin of
Tilhill Forestry Ltd, Derek Eckton &amp; Jess Allinson of the Netley Shooting
Syndicate &amp; Nick Rudley of Kingshilll Shooting Syndicate for permission to
use this delightful forest. Those of you who visited the sawmill on your courses
might like to look out for a new television film, 'Trial &amp; Retribution' soon
to be released which features the sawmill. My personal thanks go to the army of
Moles who gave generously of their time on the day to make the event run so
smoothly.&nbsp; I&nbsp; would like to give particular mention to Andrew Fisher
and his family who organised their first (and excellent) String course, and to
Julianna Grant who, as Safety Officer, also provided first aid.

        <div>
          As explained by Nick, I started controlling this event before the
          onset of the&nbsp; Foot and Mouth crisis, about eighteen months ago.
          During this time the forest very noticeably changed and during the
          week of the event forestry work was under way in three separate parts
          of the map.&nbsp; Add to this the huge numbers of logs being stored at
          the sawmill and the clay shoot, the event was a challenge for all
          concerned.&nbsp; The clay shoot resulted in Nick re-planning, at just
          three days notice, all the longer courses and this is the reason why
          some competitors may have felt there was a little too much climb, just
          when they thought they were going to finish.&nbsp; At least you all
          finished without being seriously shot!&nbsp; I witnessed one early
          competitor under fire from some out-fall shot and I decided to extend
          the Out of Bounds by moving the tapes much further south than the Clay
          Shoot had suggested would be necessary.&nbsp; I hope this caused no
          problems. With a map that is five years old it is very difficult to
          make all the controls fully acceptable for every competitor.&nbsp; The
          vegetation boundary junction (207) caused problems to some but this
          junction was certainly very obvious when finally checked three weeks
          prior to the event.&nbsp; Perhaps with the trees just coming in to
          leaf things looked very different!
          <p>The event organisation ran smoothly and Jackie seemed to have
          thought of everything.&nbsp; I hope you liked her exit road signs on
          leaving the event giving directions for Dorking / Guildford.&nbsp; We
          could do with more of these at other events.&nbsp; Both Nick and
          Jackie did an excellent job and I enjoyed my involvement.</p>
          <p>The bluebells two weeks before the event were just amazing.</p>
