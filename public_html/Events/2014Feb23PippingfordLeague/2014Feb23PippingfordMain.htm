      <b>Controller's comments</b><br>
      I hope you all enjoyed your run over Pippingford. From the many comments I 
      received afterwards, Ian’s courses were really appreciated. Most of the 
      longer courses had considerable variety of leg length including one long 
      leg over 1.5km. It seems that once you had opened the map up enough to see 
      where the end of the leg was, you liked the variety of the terrain it 
      crossed and it kept your concentration throughout. There were favourable 
      comments on Mike Elliot’s map too and with controls placed by Ian to be 
      reasonably visible, rather than hidden for example in small pits, 
      virtually all errors at controls I heard about were attributed to the 
      orienteer. This suggests that the fairness box was ticked.<br>
      <br>
      You will all have appreciated that there were a lot of controls out in the 
      forest, many not on your course seeking to tempt you off your chosen route 
      to visit them only to be disappointed. Indeed, with 166 controls used for 
      the two events, 130 of which featured during the Day event, my task as 
      Controller seemed rather daunting at first. It was only made possible with 
      the considerable help from Katy Stubbs and team who Controlled the British 
      Nights event. For the final pre-event check, we divided the controls by 
      area rather than event and I am particularly grateful for her 
      contribution. Katy also alerted me to the opportunity to create a control 
      checking course using Purple Pen for my visit on Saturday. In glorious 
      sunshine, I set off with 3 cleared dibbers for control 1 of 82 to be 
      visited that afternoon. Imagine how long a loose control description sheet 
      would have been. There were deer everywhere, from the first leg to the 
      very last one. If any were the same animal, they would have completed the 
      whole of the Green course, and probably done well in the results!<br>
      <br>
      Mike Bolton’s team worked tremendously hard to ensure all ran smoothly on 
      the day. It should not be underestimated what a challenge it is to run a 
      Night and Day event together, using different Assembly areas, but somehow 
      the team kept on going until the relief showed after the last competitor 
      had returned.<br>
      <br>
      As you can perhaps tell from the above, it was both a pleasure and a 
      privilege to be able to control this event and get many exposures to such 
      a great area for orienteering.<p align="left">
