Most of the long grass has been mown and baled. As a
result many of the rides are not as visible now as when the courses
were planned. The good news is, however, that the controls on the
ride ends and junctions are now very visible.
 
With the cutting of the grass it is now “safe” for competitors to
wear shorts. There is no tarmac (well less that 5%) so studs,
or similar will be the best footwear.
 
The “GLOSS Extension” starts at the same place as the GLOSS ends.
If you are running the GLOSS only punch at the finish control, not 216.
If you doing the “GLOSS Extension” punch at control 216 and
continue round the extension, which is on the other side of the
the GLOSS course, and punch at the finish when you complete.
 
Courses close at 13:30 so please download by then.
 
The Harvester pub is 400 metres South-east of the cap park (on the map)
if you want to refresh yourself after your run.
