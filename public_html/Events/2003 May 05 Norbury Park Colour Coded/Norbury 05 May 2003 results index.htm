        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I hope you enjoyed running at
        Norbury, which is now as varied and runnable as at any time in the past
        20 years that I’ve been walking and running over the area. A quick
        check over the area in February confirmed that although it would be
        possible to run an event on the old map, the event would be much better
        with an updated map, this time at 1:10,000. The scarp was discarded at
        this stage too – the vegetation is now too thick and brambley for
        pleasant orienteering.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">With hindsight, the only aspect
        of the event I would change would be control 210 – Brown 16. Three
        weeks before the event with the survey completed, the vegetation
        boundaries around the control fitted, and there was no sign of the
        rather substantial hut 30m (and the other side of a thicket) from the
        control.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>
        &nbsp;Thanks to Gordon for his guidance when we were finalising the
        courses, Michael for the organisation, Nick Green for assistance with
        hanging controls, Mike Elliot for looking after the IT side of the
        event, and the control collectors. And for comments overheard at the
        download tent, which suggested that you had enjoyed yourselves.</span></p>

      <td width="100%">
        <p class="MsoBodyText">After a convivial evening at the Mole Annual
        dinner in March I discovered that I had agreed to organize the Norbury
        event. Since my experience was limited it was fortunate that Mark Rowe
        was able to provide guidance as to how I should proceed. It soon became
        apparent that the Young Street Car Park would not be large enough if we
        had a big turnout. We therefore approached the Countryside Ranger for
        Norbury who agreed to open up the field beyond the Public Car Park for
        us. Accordingly we concentrated our activities in this field and
        separated the orienteers from the public.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">Thanks to the efficiency of the mole helpers the
        general state of bemusement of the organizer was concealed from the
        event participants and the event seemed to take place with no important
        glitches. We had 201 entrants, which was above our most optimistic
        forecasts. Thanks to Hugh Walker’s pre event publicity in the local
        paper a number of novice orienteers attended, these were efficiently
        looked after by Jackie Olive at the enquiry desk. Hopefully some will
        become active orienteers.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">Many thanks to Jon Coles for the efficient way he
        handled the important part of the occasion, to Gordon Parker for his
        helpful suggestions and to all the moles who gave up part of their Bank
        Holiday and without whose support this event could not have taken place.</p>

        <div>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p><span lang="EN-GB">I hope you all enjoyed
        Jon’s courses and his revised map. Jon’s decision to avoid the scarp
        slope definitely led to more pleasant courses, although it was
        surprising at how fast the forest vegetation changed over the past three
        weeks. I was pleased as usual with the efficient Mole “machine”
        where the event as always ran very smoothly under the guidance of
        Michael as organiser and Mike as computer guru.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">We made little changes to any
        of the courses as I was very happy with Jon’s range of courses – the
        positive comments we received at the finish would suggest you enjoyed
        them also.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Apologies to anyone who was
        confused by our “fated” control on the green course – number 247.
        This control was originally numbered 225, but I was unhappy about this
        numbering, as it was beside another control 226 – both controls were
        on knolls about 80-90 metres apart. Not only this, but when Jon was
        putting out the control it lost one of the numbers off the stake.
        Fortunately on the day the Sport Ident box worked OK, as Jon and I were
        becoming concerned this control was out to conspire against us!</span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">I am aware of one person who
        became confused with these controls, but I took the view that they were
        sufficiently far apart to be fair given the surrounding terrain.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">I enjoyed controlling this
        event and look forward to the next Mole Valley event.</span></p>
