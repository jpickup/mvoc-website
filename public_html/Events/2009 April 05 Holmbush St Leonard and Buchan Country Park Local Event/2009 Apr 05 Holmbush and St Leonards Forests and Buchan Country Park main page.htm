      This event was a long time in the making. It is over a decade since some 
      of the area has been used and it took a Lottery Grant and some development 
      funds from British Orienteering, West Sussex County Council and our own 
      club resources to revitalise things.</p>
      <p align="left">
      This has stitched together four areas and two permanent courses and seven 
      landowners so you can look forward to some more entertainment among the 
      thickets in the future!</p>
      <p align="left">
      The courses were planned to use the best bits of Holmwood and to give the 
      longer courses some exposure to St Leonards. Our apologies to a few 
      competitors on the Brown who discovered the paintballers had drifted 
      further south than expected.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Thanks for all the complements about the area and courses (National Event 
      standards for some, grotty green bits for others). And for the 
      constructive criticisms. I'd really like to hear any comments you would 
      like to make. Please email me: Tony AT tonyburton.org.uk (replace the AT 
      with '@')</p>
      <p align="left">
      We look forward to welcoming you to St Leonards Forest on the weekend 
      before Christmas.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Tony’s aim was originally to have 
      a long-O using the Owl Beech part of the map but due to access problems he 
      settled for a black as the longest course. Judging by the comments of the 
      finishers his efforts were appreciated by those that opted for the black 
      and brown courses as well as all of the other regular courses. Some people 
      would have preferred a short brown as the there was nothing in between 
      Blue at 6.5k and Brown at 10k.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">We had to move several controls 
      and the finish a few weeks before the event due to the clash with the 
      Paintball Games, however the agreed boundary of the paintball seemed to 
      change on the day and I apologise to those competitors whose run was 
      slightly interrupted around control 182. Thankfully nobody returned with 
      any paint on them.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thanks to Tony, Bill and all the 
      Mole Valley helpers for an excellent event. </span></p>

      <td width="100%">I could not have wished for a better day for my first 
      attempt at organising an event. Good weather makes everything so much 
      easier. By and large everything went smoothly, apart from occasional 
      attacks by paintballers and marauding geese!<p>We were very well provided 
      for by the owner of much of the land, Harry Calvert. With a good field for 
      parking and a large open shed for the event centre, which meant we didn't 
      not have to bring a tent or generator. </p>
      <p>The long distance to the start and finish were a bit of an 
      inconvenience but did not seem to worry the punters too much. My thanks to 
      Tony and Vince for designing such a variety of good courses and for 
      getting the controls out in good time so that we could start a touch on 
      the early side. </p>
      <p>One problem was revealed, not for the first time, in that it was very 
      difficult for the helpers on the second shift to get a run in and back in 
      time. Several people carried on beyond the changeover time, without a run, 
      and my particular thanks to them.</p>
      <p>Alltogether it was a very successful day, we got 231 entries although 
      only 22 were juniors which is a bit light. Perhaps if they had known about 
      the Easter eggs in advance we might have attracted more.</p>
