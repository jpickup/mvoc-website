      </b>What a contrast to the scorching heat of Epping Forest in 2005. While 
      heavy rain and slippery slopes may be among the clearest memories of 
      Balcombe Waterside we hope you enjoyed the challenging terrain, control 
      picking, views, cake, spot prizes, spectator controls, sizzling barbecues 
      and - for Blue and Green runners - the detail of the old pleasure gardens 
      to the south.<p>There is no doubt early runners had the best of the area - 
      creating the slippery conditions for others and missing some of the 
      heaviest rain. </p>
      <p>Courses were deliberately planned to make the best use of the variety 
      of features Balcombe has to offer. Tunnels, 4m crags, boulder clusters and 
      rocky pits are all too rare in southern terrain and made good use of some 
      of those rarer pictorial descriptions. </p>
      <p>Apologies to those disappointed not to see prizes for the first womens' 
      team in the open class. We were unaware of this competition. The results 
      have been calculated now and can be seen in the
        <a href="Photo%20gallery.htm">photo gallery</a>. Congratulations to 
      Southdowns. SE Relays historians have also told us of a competition for 
      the first junior team in the Open class, but none were entered this year.
      </p>
      <p>The decision not to have a Yellow course in the Junior competition was 
      deliberate since the open areas are bereft of the handrails necessary to 
      meet the standard. </p>
      <p>Thanks to Simon Greenwood not only for the kind use of his land but 
      also for the support he provided - from firming up car parks and creating 
      crossing points to personally mowing the pitching area for the tents. At 
      one early stage he even offered to alter the crop rotation to fit!</p>
      <p>Thanks also to the Mole team which turned out in force to celebrate our 
      40th anniversary and was rewarded with weather that lived up to the best 
      traditions of our events over the years. It isn't for nothing that our 
      club motto in the past was 'pluvium ad infinitum'. Jackie Olive, Simon 
      Ling and Nick Green deserve your particular thanks for long hours during 
      and before the day, as does Mike Elliot for the excellent map. Thanks are 
      also due to Steve Jarvis for his firm but fair controlling and trimming 
      the courses so winning times were kept in bounds. We were aiming at the 
      fastest time on the Blue being in the low 40 minutes. This was foiled by 
      the combination of slippery conditions, rain and an undergrowth spurt in 
      the last fortnight which brought out the brambles, bracken and wild garlic 
      in profusion (but also the bluebells).</p>
      <p>We would be interested in your feedback on the event, the courses, your 
      routes, the format for the SE Relays, or anything else. Some questions to 
      get you started: was the upper or lower gate the best for the first 
      control on the Green? What about for control 20 on either Blue? If you 
      have any comments - positive or otherwise - then email us at
      <a href="mailto:tony@tonyburton.org.uo">tony@tonyburton.org.uk</a> or 
      svogel@dircon.co.uk.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">The organisation of this year's SE Relays was very 
      much a joint effort with several key players contributing to making it a 
      seamless operation. 
      <p class="MsoNormal">Tony Burton masterminded the blueprint for the day 
      and worked out what needed to be done. Nick Green handled the team 
      entries, coped with all the changes (mainly MV) on the day and produced 
      results for the web site with great efficiency. Mike Elliot got to grips 
      with the relay software. Simon Ling worked out the detailed logistics of 
      getting everyone to the right place at the right time and laid out 
      possibly the longest piece of tape in MV's 40 year history. Mark Rowe 
      organised prize giving, dreamt up the wacky ideas for spot prizes and 
      bought the booze. Julianna Grant managed to find time from packing up her 
      life in England to organise the toilets. And I bought the cake.<p class="MsoNormal">
      The rest was down to the army of Moles who carried equipment up and down 
      the hill and stayed at their posts through gales and more gales.<p class="MsoNormal">
      Thanks to all who played a part in atrocious conditions, and thanks most 
      of all to the teams from the 11 clubs who came and took part in such good 
      spirits. We had hoped we would have been soaking up the beauty of this 
      sunken valley relaxing on the sunkissed hillside, but that was not to be.<p class="MsoNormal">
      Despite the elements, my impression was that a good time was had by most, 
      and orienteers proved yet again it takes more than a bit of mud and 
      torrential rain to dampen out spirits. 
      <p class="MsoNormal">And congratulations to the gifted few who managed to 
      get their barbecues to light!<p class="MsoNormal">Jackie Olive (Mole 
      Valley)<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</td>

      </b>I hope you all enjoyed your run around Balcombe Waterside. As you have 
      all found out the area is quite physical.....but does require a decent 
      amount of navigation skills and in relay race conditions errors tend to be 
      made more easily than when navigating alone. The setting of the changeover 
      was fantastic, even on this foulest of days. Times were longer than 
      expected, not helped of course by the recent heavy rain which made 
      underfoot conditions quite a bit tougher.<p>I know that an awful lot of 
      preparation went into this event to celebrate MV's 40th anniversary, just 
      a shame the weather put a bit of a dampener on it.</p>
      <p>Congratulations go to SN (Open winners), GO (Handicap winners), MV 
      (Junior winners) and also to SO for winning the Womens' category. 
      Unfortunately the Womens' category somehow got overlooked in both the 
      pre-event information and the on the day prizegiving. I understand a new 
      trophy will be appearing for this category and it will be strongly 
      contested at next year's SE Relay Champs on 20th May on Hampstead Heath, 
      courtesy of LOK.</p>
      <p>Finally a bit thank-you on behalf of all the competitors to Tony, 
      Sandra, Jackie and all of the other Moles who helped make this a memorable 
      event. <br>
