      <b><a name="Organisers report"></a>Organiser's Report<br>
      </b>Thank you all for coming to our event and for your kind comments (at 
      least the ones I heard were kind!) In the end everything seemed to work 
      fairly well. We overcame the problems of not being able to use the 
      intended bus pick-up point (in the smaller car park) due to the 
      overhanging trees not noticed by Countryliner when they checked it out a 
      few days ago, and the problem of the broken down bus for which the others 
      covered as well as they could while a replacement was fetched.</p>
      <p align="left">
      In the end the remote car park was probably preferable to any of the 
      nearby fields which would have been impossibly muddy given the weather 
      conditions of the last couple of weeks - and the sunny skies made up for a 
      lot of the disadvantages. For once mobile phone communication was 
      reasonably good between the event centre and the forest, and that helped 
      make things go more smoothly.</p>
      <p align="left">
      May I presume to offer grateful thanks on behalf of the competitors to all 
      the volunteer helpers without whom the event would not have happened at 
      all, and to our mapper Mike, planner Philip and controller Steve.</p>
      <p align="left">
      I have two items of lost property:</p>
      <p align="left">
      Pair of black fleece gloves dropped (I think) on the route between bus and 
      start</p>
      <p align="left">
      Thumb compass dropped near the clothing dump - somebody reported this 
      missing but I don't have your contact details</p>
      <p align="left">
      And we still have unclaimed from St Leonards (28th December) one purple 
      sweater brand Westbury at C&amp;A size small. This garment will be donated to 
      charity if not claimed shortly.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Send any claims to me by email to SimonATSimonling.org.uk (replace 'AT' 
      with @)</p>

      <b><a name="Planners report"></a>Planner's Report<br>
      </b>I first started planning back in March 2007 for our Regional event in 
      January 2008. Control sites were all taped and many of the shorter courses 
      were planned. Map updates were started that summer but extensive forestry 
      work in the autumn frustrated the update. Eventually the forestry work was 
      to continue over the winter with the result that land permission was 
      withdrawn and the event had to be postponed. The following year the 
      forestry work continued and was not expected to be complete for the 
      January 2009 date so the event was delayed by another year.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Last summer it looked like the event was on again for this January. The 
      map still had a large chunk of the new Oldlands Wood area to be surveyed 
      and drawn. During the autumn all the original control sites were revisited 
      and about 50% of the tapes were still in place, most with the writing 
      still legible. During the remainder of the year the courses were finalised 
      or planned in parallel with the map being updated. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Sheepleas was not too bad, but for much of the rest of the map there were 
      major changes in the vegetation. Many white or yellow/orange areas had 
      become various shades of green, and many green areas had become white. 
      Some of the white areas eventually had to have runability screens added 
      due to brashings from the forestry work or to undergrowth. Some controls 
      were dropped where the undergrowth was even more unpleasant than some 
      people experienced.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Having a new area, Oldlands Wood, with perhaps some of the nicest forest 
      on the map, at least with respect to running conditions, I wanted to get 
      as many people over there as possible. With the constraints of roads, 
      houses and fields it was impossible to avoid the area of brashings and 
      undergrowth and some of the hills. The whole area is also rather short of 
      decent technical control sites and too well endowed with paths and 
      distinctive rides, so some of the legs may have been a little on the easy 
      side. Hopefully this was balanced by many other legs which were more 
      challenging. Having some long legs crossing Sheepleas seemed to provide 
      quite a challenge for many people as it was easy to be confused by the 
      many paths, clearings and valleys.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Courses were planned within the latest length guidelines which allow for 
      climb. As all courses had significant climb this led to courses apparently 
      being on the short side, and a few people commented on this. If the 
      weather had been like it was over the last week or two then we would have 
      been thanked for this. There was originally a longer Black course planned 
      but when the weather changed this was dropped at the controller's 
      suggestion and the Black people were put on a slightly longer Brown course 
      with the Brown people. This saved us putting out (and checking) 6 controls 
      in remote locations in pretty unpleasant conditions, so I hope people do 
      not feel short changed.</p>
      <p align="left">
      After all the bad weather we had during recent weeks we were exceptionally 
      lucky to have had a clear sky from pre dawn till way past dark, and sunny 
      all day with no wind. The ground had completely drained following the 
      pouring rain on Saturday (which lasted until midnight), and was just crisp 
      with the very light frost. Nearly all the snow had gone and many people 
      came back with dry feet. A bit different from a couple of my recent visits 
      when everything was snow covered!</p>
      <p align="left">
      I spent a long time at the finish line and we had many good comments and 
      no complaints, although some did mention the brashings and brambles. Mike 
      must have got the map about right as it hardly got a mention.</p>
      <p align="left">
      My thanks to controller Steve for his input, helpful suggestions and 
      checking.</p>

      <b><a name="Controllers Report"></a>Controller's Report<br>
      </b>Comments were mostly favourable from conversations overheard as I sat 
      at the finish, I think the fine weather and the desire for you to get in 
      the forest after Christmas makes even the deepest bramble seem pleasant 
      (well, nearly!)</p>
      <p align="left">
      Apologies for asking the planner to combine Black with Brown. The extreme 
      weather conditions the week before coupled with an entry of only four 
      people on the Black course meant it seemed a good decision at the time. In 
      the weeks before the event (and pre snow) gg had run the Black course in 
      90 minutes. Although this was not race conditions it was clear that to run 
      the course in conditions of high snow levels (had they remained), may have 
      put runners at risk.</p>
