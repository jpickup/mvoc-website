      <h3>Organiser's report</h3>
      <p>What a scorcher! I'd like to thank Geoff Newton for all his efforts 
      with regard to this event, which went far beyond the planners normal 
      duties.&nbsp; Geoff acted as both organiser and planner for the entire event 
      until I returned from holiday just a week and a half prior to the event.&nbsp; 
      To return with everything sorted out for me was a great relief, and left 
      me with just the 'on the day' organisers duties to perform - by far what I 
      prefer anyway!</p>
      <p>With a loyal and enthusiastic band of club helpers everything on the 
      day seemed to go smoothly, thank you to all the Moles who assisted. Once 
      again you did all your roles very efficiently - so I disappeared into the 
      err...open space! to sample the course! Great training it was for the 
      Scottish 6 it was too!&nbsp; The atmosphere in the car park seemed very 
      friendly - for me a large part of what the frolics is all about. Thank you 
      to those who complimented the event too - those sentiments go a long way 
      to encourage you to do it all again!</p>
      <p>Congratulations to SLOW on their victory in the frolics competition - 
      sets the series up very nicely for the finale next week!</p>
      <p>Finally two pieces of lost property were left behind: 1 A left handed 
      Moscow thumb compass and 2. A childs (7-8 yrs) t-shirt, white and black 
      with a '23' logo on it.&nbsp; Contact me if either of them belong to you.</p>

      <h3>Planner's report</h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Mid July is not the best time of year to orienteer in 
      South East England, let alone on&nbsp;&nbsp; the Hogsmill with its rampant nettles, 
      brambles and blackthorn. When it was proposed to hold the Frolic here last 
      year I vetoed it for this reason. However a Saturday event last October on 
      a sunny autumn day went down very well with the punters so I relented for 
      this year.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the nettles etc, it’s too small, it’s 
      devoid of contours, and it’s packed full of line features. However the 
      thickets, fences and streams do introduce route choice and the area has an 
      element of novelty for the orienteer who has done everything. For what its 
      worth, the area was the site of one of the earliest gunpowder mills in the 
      country and is a haven for wildlife. I saw five herons in one day on the 
      build up to the event.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Each event held here in summer or autumn needs a path 
      clearance session and on this occasion I overlooked some of the approaches 
      to control 204 which inconvenienced some competitors, for which I 
      apologise. However those of you who complained the control was in the 
      wrong place were subsequently found to have mismarked your maps. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Given the roasting temperatures, the Frolics Course 
      was probably too long for the&nbsp;oldest and the youngest competitors. There 
      seemed to be very few in those categories on that course however, which 
      perhaps says something about the Frolics generally these days. </p>
