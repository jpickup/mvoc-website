      <b><a name="Organisers report"></a>Organiser's Report<br>
      </b>First of all I should like to apologise to all those who were unable 
      to enter the event for their chosen course because they missed the event 
      closing date on the 8th January or because we were unable to offer entry 
      on the day for the harder courses.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Polesden Lacey is a busy place on most Sundays and naturally neither Mole 
      Valley OC nor the National Trust wished to impede the general public’s 
      visits to this popular property. We had available the ability to park 250 
      cars plus one coach at Polesden.<br>
      Pre entries to this event substantially exceeded expectations. One third 
      of the pre entries were received in the last 28 hours before the closing 
      date.</p>
      <p align="left">
      We had alternative car parking available on Ranmore but this was in many 
      ways unsatisfactory. It was clear that the availability of maps for entry 
      on the day was going to be very limited. I therefore opted to concentrate 
      this limited availability onto the light green, orange and yellow courses 
      so that we could look after the juniors and the novices and not encourage 
      others to make long journeys for very limited map availability.</p>
      <p align="left">
      The situation regarding entry on the day was clearly advertised on the 
      Mole Valley website and the event final details advised event entrants to 
      check the MV website before travel.</p>
      <p align="left">
      In addition we asked you to share cars where possible. You responded to 
      this appeal and I am very grateful to all those who shared cars. Many 
      thanks. So with your help we were able to fit all cars into Polesden Lacey 
      and did not need the overflow car parks. </p>
      <p align="left">
      There were few incidents on the day. Some horses did not like the tape to 
      the start nor runners running past them but nobody was injured and a 
      formal complaint was not made. So far as I am aware there were no serious 
      injuries. We completed our safety check at 4.00pm and had the tape cleaned 
      up by 4.45pm.<br>
      <br>
      Many thanks to all the event helpers, many of whom worked from dawn to 
      dusk. They did a great job. Many thanks to Mike Elliot who agreed to 
      control the event after 25 South East controllers had declined. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Many thanks to all those who came to the event. Hope you enjoyed your day. </p>
      <p align="left">
      And many thanks to the National Trust at Polesden Lacey, the National 
      Trust wardens and staff on Ranmore and to Denbies Vineyard for allowing us 
      the use of their properties.<br>
      <br>
      One moan. It seems unsatisfactory that BOF only advise event organisers on 
      the 16th December 2010 of the clubs that are allocated to their heat and 
      the anticipated entry for each club. Event organisers cannot work 
      miracles. Parking areas are not easy to find in this area of heavy clay 
      and winter waterlogged fields.</p>

      <b><a name="Planners report"></a>Planner's Report<br>
      </b>For those of you with long orienteering memories Ranmore Common 
      combines <br>
      superb open runnable beech woods with challenging contours and a plethora
      <br>
      of mega-depressions. This disappeared with the Great Storm in 1987 and it
      <br>
      could be 30 years or more before we can enjoy Ranmore at its best again.
      <br>
      In the meantime the holly, yew, contours and low visibility offer a <br>
      different challenge to both mapper and competitor. We were pleased to see
      <br>
      courses being won in and around the expected times but the spread of times
      <br>
      and post race comments indicate that many of you found things tough. The
      <br>
      courses were planned to be as hard as possible but the mixed runnability
      <br>
      made one or two sites less than ideal and relocation tricky.<br>
      <br>
      My thanks to Michael White for tackling every twist in the organisation
      <br>
      with his usual good humour, to Mike Elliot who burnt the oil at both ends
      <br>
      on the mapping and controlling and to all those Moles who helped with <br>
      boxes and control collection over and above their other duties on the day.</p>
