      <p>&nbsp;<p><b>Planner's Report</b><p class="MsoNormal">
      <span lang="EN-US">The main objective for me was to try to rehabilitate 
      Ranmore’s reputation after January’s CompassSport Cup event –surely it 
      doesn’t really deserve a mention in the Nopesport thread “101 maps not to 
      run on before you die”?!&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      I therefore tried to concentrate on the better bits of forest (i.e. the 
      white parts of the map) and control sites that offered a fair navigational 
      challenge.&nbsp; My intention was to combine fine navigation with some 
      opportunities for route choice, although the north-south path network and 
      blocks of walk/fight don’t lend themselves to this.&nbsp; The runnability did 
      in fact improve markedly as autumn progressed and I hope you were as 
      pleasantly surprised as I was.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">My thanks go to Charlie Turner for 
      taking the event on and for all his help and advice, in particular on 
      interpreting the map in several key areas, and to all those Moles who 
      helped in putting out and collecting in controls, always a challenge with 
      the limited daylight.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p>Nick Green, MV<p><b>Organiser's Report</b><p>
      With memories of most MV events having pouring rain we were fortunate to 
      have a fine mostly sunny day, albeit very cold with a bit of frost in the 
      morning. There was even a little snow out in the woods, but the forecast 
      rain did not come until everything was packed away and we were bound for 
      home at about 4pm.<br>
      <br>
      I managed to get out for a run and was pleased that Nick had managed to 
      get most of my course in the best bits. I hardly noticed any holly until 
      3/4 of the way round, and even after that is was not a problem. I think 
      the woods were the best that I can remember them.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from one competitor being a little late back things seemed to run 
      pretty smoothly. Perhaps our worst problem was when the general public 
      started to come into &quot;our&quot; car parking field via the exit, partly directed 
      by NT staff. Unfortunately their parking was somewhat haphazard so 
      apologies if anybody was boxed in for a while. Another more amusing 
      problem was when we had to push an AA rescue van out of the parking field.<br>
      <br>
      The NT were very pleased to have us and are keen to have us back again. 
      Thanks to them for their hospitality at Polesden Lacey and allowing us to 
      use Ranmore Common.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks also to the Mole team of volunteers who made everything happen, 
      also John Brown of SN who was our Safety Officer and Charlie Turner (SLOW) 
      who controlled at quite short notice.<br>
      <br>
      Philip Gristwood, MV<p><b>Controller's Report</b><p class="MsoPlainText">
    Ranmore with its five 
      parallel valleys and generally thick vegetation is a physically 
      challenging area.&nbsp; Trying to map vegetation for its runnability is more 
      than often going to be subjective and in an area like Ranmore, it is best 
      to use other mapped features for accurate map reading.&nbsp; Nick made the best 
      out of the area and I had very little impact on his courses.&nbsp; People were 
      mainly positive about their courses and some even said they had had near 
      perfect runs, albeit with the climb, vegetation and sticky clay it was 
      tough and rough.
      
    
      <p class="MsoPlainText">
    I only got to the event car park well after the last 
      competitor had left for home and from all accounts I gathered that Philip 
      had well organised the Moles to make sure things ran smoothly.&nbsp;
