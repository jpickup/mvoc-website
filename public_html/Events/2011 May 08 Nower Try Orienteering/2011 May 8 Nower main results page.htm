      <b>Planner's Comments</b><br>
      When I planned the courses for the event there was not a single stick of 
      bracken spoiling excellent visibility, hence I thought that I would make 
      the Orange course a little different by using a series of short legs in 
      the western side of the map using control sites which were a bit more 
      technicalthan usual, but with plenty of catching features. Mother Nature 
      slightly fouled this approach up by suddenly allowing the vegetation to 
      grow to M12 proportions, but I am glad to see that everybody on that 
      course triumphed over this adversity, and I hope that you enjoyed the 
      opportunity of hunting the odd control in the jungle!<br>
      <br>
      One apology; the site for control 215 (16 on Orange and 4 on Green) was 
      moved and was not exactly as mapped as the woodland was not really &quot;white&quot; 
      as the holly had introduced a tinge of green which had escaped my eye for 
      some reason, and many thanks to Jon for putting me right and moving the 
      control to a more prominent position. Otherwise the elderly map was rather 
      more &quot;roughly right&quot; than &quot;precisely wrong&quot; and is certainly showing its 
      age<br>
      with many features having changed. I was not tempted to re-map as I fear 
      that that is not a skill I possess, and if any changes I made turned out 
      to be right it would be more from luck than anything else. I hope that the 
      additional challenge just made the day more interesting!<br>
      <br>
      It was great to see a number of new faces, especially of the younger 
      variety, and I do hope that this event has whetted your appetite to come 
      along next time; I accompanied Jack and his partner on part of their 
      Orange course, and it was a real treat to see how they sometimes chose to 
      take the difficult route in to a control and found it first time. I wish I 
      could do that.......<br>
      <br>
      Until next time, and of course many thanks to the Moles who helped through 
      the day.<br>

      <b>Organiser's Comments<br>
      </b>Well, the sun shone for much of the day and most of the newcomers to 
      the sport seemed to have a good time. Of the 40 competitors who ran, more 
      than half were not members of an orienteering club, with most orienteering 
      for the first time. Some of the times recorded were pretty impressive; 
      especially the Fleming family who had a storming win on the yellow course.<br>
      <br>
      Many thanks to all the volunteers who turned up to help on the day. This 
      may be one of our low key events and holding it in conjunction with the 
      Surrey Hills Race does reduce my workload as organiser; but it doesn't 
      reduce what needs to be done on the day. The feedback from the competitors 
      was that they enjoyed the courses that Chris planned with many of the 
      newcomers looking forward to future events.<br>
