      <p><a name="Planners Comments"></a>&nbsp;<b>Planner's Comments</b><p>
      Unusually I am writing this two weeks before the event and while it is 
      still provisional. The reason for the postponement was an injury to our 
      mapper, Mike, and it meant that I would be out of the country at the time. 
      The map has in any event taken much longer to prepare than expected. 
      Partly this is because the area has changed out of almost all recognition 
      since the last map was drawn 20 years ago, and partly because both Ashtead 
      and Epsom Commons are subject to very active management by the respective 
      wardens. Conservation volunteers were still clearing blackthorn scrub near 
      the start only last Thursday!<p>I have been walking my dogs on Ashtead 
      Common for many years and I am very fond of the place. You may not be so 
      happy with it after encountering the mud and brambles, but I can assure 
      you on a warm summer's evening it can be magical!<p>The late arrival of 
      the map has of course posed considerable planning difficulties. For 
      example, although I could find control sites, whether on the old map or 
      not, they did not always turn out to be shown as I expected on the new 
      map. The considerable development of the path and ride network in the last 
      twenty years also meant that some legs turned out to have obvious path 
      routes which I had not appreciated from walking the area. 
      <p>I hope I have posed a few route choice problems and navigational 
      challenges. As I shall not be there to receive your congratulations or 
      criticisms on the day, I would much appreciate comments by email via our 
      web site, of any nature, whether general or specific. Next time there will 
      be a map available when the planners starts work and he or she can take 
      your thoughts into account. 
      <p>Finally I would like to thank all those who have worked hard to assist 
      me, particularly Mike, who has put in far more hours and walked many more 
      miles than I have; Ted the organiser; Tony and Sandra who stood in for me 
      on the day, and Andrew the controller. You have all been marvellous!<p>5 
      December 05<br>
      Simon Ling, Mole Valley<p><a name="Organisers Comments"></a><b>Organiser's 
      Comments</b><p class="MsoNormal">The cold but very bright morning brought 
      out over 200 runners to enjoy the courses set by Simon Ling on Mike 
      Elliot’s new map of Ashtead and Epsom Commons.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Having use of the Scout Hall was great for helpers 
      and we hope you all appreciated the indoor facilities.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The one month postponement of the event meant that 
      Simon was far away in India on the day, but I want to thank him for the 
      perfect preparation, and Sandra Vogel and Tony Burton for supervising 
      control placements on the day.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Controller Andrew Evans deserves thanks for his 
      excellent support and especially for accommodating the very tight schedule 
      for this event.&nbsp; Finally I want to thank all the MV helpers their 
      enthusiastic support and especially for their initiatives in covering up 
      any deficiencies in the overall organisation.</p>
      <p>Ted McDonald, Mole Valley<p><a name="Controllers Comments"></a><b>
      Controller's Comments</b><p>A control site in an out of bounds are! 
      Another in a lake! What on earth is going on here? These were my first 
      reactions on seeing the courses superimposed on the previous map of the 
      area. It all became much clearer hen the extent of the changes needed to 
      the previous 1988 map were understood. Even the contours needed revision. 
      We often take for granted the standard of the map - our expectations have 
      risen so much over the years as the quality of the maps has increased.<p>
      The main decision to make was whether it was possible for the event to go 
      ahead on the revised date. It became apparent that I would only see the 
      eastern side of the map on the Wednesday before the event. Nevertheless, 
      with this and a Plan B from Simon for revised red and blue courses, but no 
      brown, we decided to push ahead with what was an extremely tight 
      timetable.<p>The map was duly completed thanks to Mike's sterling 
      dedication to the job. We were also helped by the very cold start to the 
      day, which ensured the maps were not still hot from the print run when you 
      picked them up. As Simon has mentioned, it is not easy to plan the courses 
      and draw the control sites up on a blank base map, but when all was 
      revealed little changed.<p>On the day we identified two controls, both 
      first controls in courses near the start and hence among the last to be 
      put out, which were not bleeping. It took a bit of time to replace these 
      and I appreciate the patience of those early starters on the red and 
      orange courses in particular as this was done. Fortunately all other 
      controls worked properly throughout.<p>Ted had marshalled a strong 
      contingent of MV helpers with a chance for everyone also to run, which 
      helped the day go smoothly. The large turnout I think reinforced the 
      decision to seek to proceed if at all possible and I thank you for 
      supporting the event. Congratulations to Helen Errington (HH) and Alan 
      Velecky (SO) the South East Veterans Champions and to the Collins family 
      for winning the South East Families event.<p>Andrew Evans, DFOK<p>&nbsp;</td>
