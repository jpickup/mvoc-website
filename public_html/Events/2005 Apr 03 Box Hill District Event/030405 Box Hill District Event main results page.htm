        Box Hill, with it's flat(ish) summit and many paths is a very easy place 
        on which to plan the less technical courses. However, the shortage of 
        runnable forest and lack of intricacy in the contours make the technical 
        courses harder. I tried to take advantage of the terrain and provide a 
        degree of route choice which is rarely encountered in the south-east, 
        and also to provide a couple of legs requiring more accurate navigation 
        early and late in the course.</div>
      <div>
        <br>
        If I listed all the people who helped it would be long and boring to 
        read, so I'll just say thanks - you know who you are. I must however 
        mention controller Mike Murray for checking the controls sites and 
        courses and spotting an error in a master map, and to Jackie for her 
        genius in organising unbroken sunshine when precipitation was forecast 
        only 24 hours earlier. Even as I type this after the event, the sun is 
        still shining and the Met Office web site says it is &quot;fairly cloudy&quot;.</div>
      <div>
        <br>
        Thank you all for coming, and for some kind comments afterwards,<br>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Many thanks to the small but very 
      hard working band of Moles who gave up their time on Sunday to make sure 
      everything ran more or less to plan. It was a pleasure to organise an 
      event where all the key stations were within 250 </span>metres<span lang="EN-US"> 
      of each other, and not much further to flushing loos. My thanks to Peter 
      Creasey and the other National Trust wardens for giving us permission to 
      use this beautiful area (and for not arresting Ian as he put out the 
      controls after dark on Saturday.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Although overall numbers were 
      slightly disappointing it was great that so many juniors took part in the 
      Young Orienteers Festival and I am assembling a strong team to take to the 
      National YOF in Battersea Park on May 2<sup>nd </sup>. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It was a happy bunch of Trail 
      Challengers that eventually found its way back to well-earned prizes. 
      Orienteers don’t seem to need prizes; perhaps the joy of cruising through 
      sunlit forests is reward enough. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Thanks to Nick and Cynthia who 
      prepared an excellent String course, it was just a shame that more 
      children did not have a go.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Those of you whose arms (like 
      mine) are getting a bit short for the 1:15,000 map will be glad to hear 
      that our stocks are nearly exhausted and for future events on Box Hill we 
      will be able to offer a range of scales.</span><br>

        &quot;The best blue course I've ever run&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        &quot;My Dad said don't run up and down the hills - but it seemed the only 
        choice&quot; <br>
        <br>
        - but two comments on Ian's courses.</div>
      <div>
        <br clear="left">
        Well the flier did promise route choice and you chose some interesting 
        routes on the big legs, and the planners worked hard to create some 
        challenging routes.&nbsp; Blue 4 to 5 and Brown 8 to 9&nbsp; -&nbsp; 216 to 235 was 
        probably the best on the longer courses. Ian stated that nobody in their 
        right mind would go direct and so when I trialled the Blue course I 
        &quot;redlined&quot; its 5.0 km and can now confirm his wisdom.&nbsp; I think the path 
        route to the north east is best.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        Green 4 to 5, Blue 7 to 8 and Brown 11 to 12&nbsp; - 230 to 220 invited you 
        to go direct - and wonder if the long path route southwards was quicker 
        as you struggled up to Juniper Top. Perhaps the control sites could have 
        been easier on the Trail challenge and I hope that the fine weather and 
        1&nbsp; : 10000 map off set any navigational problems.</div>
      <div>
        <br>
        Well done Jackie on marshalling all the Moles, Nigel for his Trail 
        challenge courses and Ian for the colour coded.</div>
