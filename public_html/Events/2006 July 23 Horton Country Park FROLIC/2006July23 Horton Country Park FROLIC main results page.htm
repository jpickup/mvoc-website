It’s holiday time. Many Moles were to be away orienteering in exotic
places. I found myself doing the early stages of the organisation as
well, until Ted McDonald thankfully stepped into the breach and I also
had to find a last minute replacement cartographer in Ian Ditchfield. A
Controller did not materialise but Philip Gristwood did an armchair job
on the courses and made many useful suggestions.<br>
            <br>
Philip was not to know the undergrowth was going ballistic. I had to
spend a fair amount of time reinstating key paths, but I didn’t really
appreciate how unpleasant the West part of the new part of the map had
become. So comments on the Frolics courses were generally favourable
apart from the legs in that area. These bits are very pleasant and
interesting in the winter. Honest! At least the hay meadows were cut a
couple of days before the event which made life less physical on some
parts of the courses albeit at the price of obscuring some paths. If we
had used master maps we could have made course changes right up to the
last minute. To cap it all I cracked a metatarsal a few days before the
event, so putting out the controls took me a bit longer than expected.<br>
            <br>
The start team took it upon themselves, for good reasons I am sure, to
relocate the start some distance from the start flag. However they may
not always have made sure you were aware that the triangle on the map
was at that flag 60m along the track. I hope this did not cause anyone
problems on the 1st control.<br>
            <br>
It would have been easy to plan a good Yellow course in the southern
part of the map with start and finish close to the car park.
Unfortunately the Frolics course would then also have been mostly of
yellow standard with lots of dead running. The Yellow course provided
was tougher than the norm, but in the absence of an orange course we
would tend to err on this side. All the controls were on or very close
to paths, with the exception of one on the side of a large pond in the
open which was 60m away from large tracks, but there was more route
choice on some legs than is usual for Yellow. Although times were on
the long side there were no more retired or missed punches than is
usual on Yellow.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The gates to our parking
field were
still securely chained a good half hour after the promised opening
time and I was very relieved to see the white ranger truck arrive
soon after, thanks to mobile phone pleas. After that everything
seemed to run smoothly and several of you said you’d enjoyed your
runs despite the seasonal undergrowth. Many thanks for coming along
in such good numbers to run Geoff’s courses on his new map
extension.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">No organiser could cope without
willing
and flexible help from club volunteers and I am most grateful to the
team that did such a great job at Horton and to Geoff for his overall
guidance in addition to his Planning role.</p>
