      <b>Planner's Report</b></p>
      <p align="left">
      This event was originally scheduled for the spring but had to be postponed 
      because of building and landscaping works in the school at Gatton Park. 
      Many of you will have seen that some building is still going on, but the 
      current works seem to cause less concern to the authorities.<br>
      <br>
      I wondered whether we would get many customers for an August event, but in 
      fact entries were higher than at either of the two previous SE 
      Middle-Distance Championships (I haven't looked back any further), which 
      were held at more conventional times of year. Traditionally, serious 
      orienteering in the south-east has taken a break for August, but this 
      shows that there is still a demand for good quality competition even at 
      the height of the holiday season.<br>
      <br>
      I tried to plan proper middle-distance courses, keeping your brains busy 
      and denying you the chance to switch off on long path runs. I couldn't 
      completely avoid the path runs, and in particular they formed a higher 
      proportion of the Green than I would have liked. Nevertheless, many of you 
      were kind enough to say how much you appreciated the courses.<br>
      <br>
      The timing of this event was not ideal for me to plan, since I was away 
      for all but five days of the three weeks leading up to the event. With the 
      school still changing, I would like to thank Mike Elliot not just for 
      continually updating the map, but also updating the courses and sending 
      them to the printers while I was away. I would also like to thank Mike 
      Murray for his laid-back controlling, and tolerance of continually missed 
      deadlines.<br>
      <br>
      Other thanks are due to Keith Masson and his team of volunteers, everybody 
      who collected controls, the National Trust, the Gatton Trust, and 
      everybody who came and ran. I hope you enjoyed your first visit to this 
      area as much as I enjoyed planning on it.<br>

      Many thanks to everyone who came to the event; hope you enjoyed your run 
      and the event.</p>
      <p align="left">
      A big thank you to everyone involved in the planning of the event from: 
      The Royal Alexandra and Albert School; St. Bedes School; The National 
      Trust and the Gatton Trust and to Mike Elliot, Ian Ditchfield and Mike 
      Murray for the map; planning and controlling.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Thank you to all our volunteers who helped on the day, including Ruth 
      Rhodes from SO.</p>
      <p align="left">
      The event seemed to run fairly smoothly, much helped by the lovely 
      weather. The 2 starts, far apart, and a marshaled road crossing stretched 
      our available volunteers, but I think we got away with it! The car park 
      seemed to fill up very quickly, partly due to a lot more EODs’ than 
      expected – thank you to Maro (St. Bedes Caretaker) for allowing us to 
      overflow into the Church Service car park!<br>
      Some confusion was caused by me putting up the sign warning of the 
      problems with SI dibber versions 8 and 9; bit I think it was better to do 
      this than have more competitors returning from the start with dibbers that 
      didn’t work! – I think only one person had to do this.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Apologies to SEOA for not checking the medal situation as regards the 
      Middle Distance Champs. – hope you enjoyed getting all your medals!</p>
