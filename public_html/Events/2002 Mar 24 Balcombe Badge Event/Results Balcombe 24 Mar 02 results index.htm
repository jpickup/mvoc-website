        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:6.0pt;text-align:justify">I think
        I’ve found the secret to providing courses which will keep most people
        happy. It’s not mentioned in BOF guidelines, but provide a nice sunny
        spring day, and you’ll get few complaints!</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">Balcombe is not a technically difficult area, so
        I tried to encourage you to make your own mistakes. The idea was to get
        you running fast through fields and along tracks; and then give you some
        short and (relatively) technical legs in the forest. I am pleased to see
        from the splits that even most course winners lost significant time
        somewhere.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">My other objective was to give you some pleasant
        memories of the forest, with some spectacular control sites, and the
        finish in the nicest bit by the reservoir. The disadvantage of this last
        strategy was the long slog back to the car park.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">The only previous Badge event at Balcombe was
        part of the 2000 Spring in the South series. Times on that seemed
        slightly short, as was appropriate for the third day of a multi-day
        event, so I made my courses slightly longer. The results suggest that
        most lengths were about right, but the three longest courses were a
        little overdone. I hope your legs have recovered for the JK!</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">Most people will tell you that the young junior
        courses are hardest to plan, but I find the 70 &amp; 75 courses harder.
        Trying to provide the highest level of technical difficulty while
        keeping to physically easy terrain is quite a challenge, and I did
        receive suggestions that course 12 (M75S, W60-75S) in particular was too
        taxing. However, I am pleased to see that everyone did complete
        successfully, and I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">The other contentious issue is whether some of
        the crags, in particular the waterfall (control 180), should have been
        taped. My judgement was that nobody was likely to fall down this one;
        the vegetation on the top would prevent you running over it too fast to
        stop. I am aware that some disagreed, although happily nobody proved me
        wrong by breaking their neck!</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">There are lots of people I ought to thank, and
        space prevents me from listing everybody. I must particularly mention
        gamekeeper John Lewis for delaying the fencing of the new pheasant pens,
        forester Jamie Kirkland for preserving a taped control site intact which
        clear-felling around it, and controller Mike Murray for his quiet
        guidance.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText">I look forwards to running at Balcome myself in
        the Southern Express on 20<sup>th</sup> April.</p>

        <h3><a name="organisers report"></a>Organisers' report</h3>
        <div>
          This event&nbsp; seemed to have a curse on the organisers, the
          original organiser was Eddie Whiston, but unfortunately he suffered a
          stroke, thankfully he is making good progress and we wish him all the
          best for a
        </div>
        <div>
          complete and speedy recovery.&nbsp; Then with 2 weeks to go Julianna
          Grant was taken ill and so Mark Rowe took over most of the
          organisation from there until the day, although many of you would have
          seen that Julianna was there on the day making a very valuable
          contribution and able to see the fruits of her labours over the
          previous months. Ultimately we ended up as joint organisers and this
          worked very well, being able to bounce ideas and questions off each
          other, and sharing the stress of an event like this!
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div>
          Thank you all very much for coming, and for the favourable comments
          that you gave us after having finished your courses. Everything seemed
          to go relatively smoothly on the day, thanks no doubt to an excellent
          turnout to help from Mole Valley members, the size of the club meaning
          that nowadays we do need 100% of the membership to help to run a badge
          event properly. Thanks in particular go to Mike Elliot for running the
          computing side of the event, the size and importance of this role
          almost warranting status as the fourth official nowadays, and to
          Laurence Townley for his help in the days prior to the event and on
          the day being one of the first helpers there, even though he came all
          the way from Cambridge!
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div>
          Thanks also go to the landowner and South East Chairman Simon
          Greenwood for the use once again of his land, and land agent Charles
          Thomason, nothing being too much trouble in the run up to the event!
          We even had a car park created specially for us! - how many other
          events are able to claim that I wonder!

            It was a pleasure to control the Moles' Balcombe event. The High
            Weald is a wonderful mixture of open spaces separated by deeply
            incised streams with their wooded valleys.&nbsp; In addition the
            early spring date enabled us to enjoy Ian's courses which required
            little interference from me, the only changes resulting from the
            recent landscaping of the new pheasant pens.
          </div>
          &nbsp;
          <div>
            Mike E. had put a lot of effort into giving you an up to date map
            which was easy to read in spite of the crowded detail on the ground.

            Mark and Julianna kept me fully informed at all times and all their
