                  Skiklubb</a> since the early 1970's, Blodslitet is a

                competitors returning to the finish arena after each
                lap. The literal translation of ¨Blodslitet¨ is ¨Blood
                Spiller¨. This gives an idea of the original thinking
                behind the event, but thankfully it has been toned down
                a little to accommodate some of us lesser mortals! <a

                mine of information: it contains much valuable data, but
                some of it is hard to dig out.<br>
                <br>
                Officially, the term ¨BOF¨ should no longer be used, as
                it has been realised that it means nothing to the
                uninitiated, whereas the new name “British Orienteering”
                is much clearer. However, as evidenced by this web page,
                old habits die hard! <br>
                <br>
                Membership of BOF is mildly confusing. BOF is a
                Federation of twelve associations, nine of them <a
                  href="#Region">regional associations</a> such as the <a
                  href="#SEOA">SEOA</a>, plus three <a href="#Nation">national&nbsp;associations</a>
                for Wales, Scotland &amp; Northern Ireland. However, the
                members with voting rights at the AGM are individual
                orienteers, not the associations which make up the
                federation. Every serious orienteer in the UK is a
                member of BOF, and the vast majority are also members of
                a club and a regional or national association. There is
                usually some proposal outstanding to change this system.<br>

                Unfortunately, many South-East areas are not technically

                in the South-East normally claim to put on a full range
                of courses. This means that the theory breaks down, and
                courses of the same colour tend to be more technical in

              <dd>This annual event is the most important inter-club
                competition. Traditionally, it was a knock-out
                competition with pairs of clubs competing against each
                other in a series of rounds, along the lines of
                football's FA Cup. The current format has only two
                rounds, the first being regional heats at which around
                six clubs compete for a single place in the final. The
                competition was invented by <a href="#CompassSport">CompassSport&nbsp;magazine</a>
                but is run by <a href="#BOF">BOF</a>.
                <p>A CompassSport Cup event requires eight different
                  courses, with people from different <a
                    href="#AgeClass">age classes</a> running different
                  courses. Each competing club can provide as many
                  runners as it likes on each course. There is no
                  advance team selection and the “best” 25 performances
                  from each club count, subject to some constraints to
                  ensure that successful clubs field people in a wide
                  variety of age classes. <a target="csweb"

                series of (usually) four events on consecutive weekends
                in July, held on areas within or very close to the M25.
                The areas need to have an extensive path network or a
                large amount of mown grass, since running cross-country
                in the South-East in high summer is rarely pleasant.
                Every competitor runs the same course of <a
                  href="#LightGreen">Light&nbsp;Green</a> standard. The
                Frolics are of particular interest to new orienteers as
                there is a handicap system which adjusts not just for <a
                  href="#AgeClass">age&nbsp;class</a> as usual, but also
                for performance record. Thus being an experienced
                orienteer is a substantial disadvantage. Originally
                there was a strong bias to the social side with events
                in London Parks and pre-entered teams of 8 from
                different clubs locked in friendly rivalry before
                recourse to the pub. Nowadays the events have become
                more normal: entry on the day, and no limit on team
                size, although only six can score from each club, but it
                is hoped the basic sociability coming from everyone
                running the same course carries on. More information on

                Sometimes there's also a Short Green course, of the same
                standard but shorter. Occasionally there's even a Very
                Short Green. This last would probably be aimed at the
                oldest and most frail competitors, so the planner should
                attempt the difficult feat of producing a course which
                is technically hard but physically easy.<br>

              <dd>A handicap competition is usually one in which the

                allow people from different <a href="#AgeClass">age
                  classes</a> to compete on level terms. For an
                individual competition, this would normally be done by
                multiplying time taken or points scored by a different
                factor for each class. For a <a href="#Relay">relay</a>,
                each class would be allocated a number of handicap

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A team event which
                  requires planning and coordination under time
                  pressure, originating in Germany and introduced to the
                  UK in the late 1980's by the then chairman of army
                  orienteering, Lt. Col. Steve Harris. Despite the relay
                  in the name, all team members receive identical maps
                  and run simultaneously. It is a <a href="#Spanish">Spanish&nbsp;Score</a>
                  event, with two sets of controls. ¨Spine¨ controls
                  must be visited by each and every team member. The
                  remaining controls need be visited by only one team
                  member. The team's time is that of the last member to
                  reach the finish. Failure to collectively punch each
                  control or individually punch each spine control will
                  be penalised, by a hefty time penalty or possibly
                  outright disqualification. It is vital for the team to
                  plan and agree who is going to which controls before
                  leaving the start!</p>

              <dd>Annual relay, held in a different region of the county
                each year, usually in summer. Possibly the most
                eccentric event in the calendar. The main event is a
                seven person relay, with the start timed so that the
                first three or four laps are run in the dark, with the
                remainder after dawn. Usually, this means a start soon
                after the pubs close for the night! There is also a
                five-person relay with shorter laps.
                <p>The main prizes are on the seven-person course, an
                  open class in which any combination can run, and a <a

              <dd>One of the functions of <a href="#BOF">BOF</a> is to
                periodically change the names which indicate the
                relative status of orienteering events. From May 2017,
                the lowest level of formal orienteering event has been
                renamed from <a href="#Level">Level D</a> to "Local"; a
                reversion to the name as it had two reorganisations ago.
                The next level up is now "<a href="#Regional">Regional</a>"
                event. Local events are minor events put on by clubs
                primarily for their own members (and newcomers) with
                little or no co-ordination with other clubs. They have
                some advantages: they tend to be cheap to enter, easy to
                put on, and not too crowded. Many orienteers go to more
                local events than any other sort.</dd>

              <dd>At events of <a href="#Level">Level B</a> and higher
                standard, adult competitors usually have a choice of
                Long and <a href="#Scourse">Short</a> <a
                  href="#AgeClass">age class</a> courses. These should
                be of equal difficulty, and in theory are of equal
                merit. However, almost all of the top orienteers will
                run Long in preference to Short. (At <a href="#Level">Level&nbsp;A</a>
                Events and above, there may also be an <a
                  href="#Ecourse">elite</a> course for M21 and W21.)</dd>
              <dt><a name="Loop"></a>Loop race</dt>
              <dd>A loop race is a <a href="#Mass">mass start</a>
                event, producing head-to-head racing with the winner
                being the first to cross the finish line. Some
                requirement to navigate is preserved by the courses
                being <a href="#Gaffle">gaffled</a>, which means that,
                while each person eventually runs the same <a
                  href="#Leg">legs</a> as every other, the sequence may
                be different.
                <p>There are two different ways to achieve this. One is
                  to have effectively a one-person <a href="#Relay">relay</a>,
                  with the competitors running two, three, or even more
                  (depending on the competition rules) laps
                  consecutively, using a map which shows only one lap.
                  Each lap would share the same start and finish, which
                  would be adjacent, and there would be a <a
                    href="#Exchange">map exchange</a> between laps. </p>
                <p>The alternative is for the entire course to be
                  printed on just one map. It is still necessary for the
                  competitors to keep revisiting a single point at which
                  the different loops start and finish, but this need no
                  longer be the start and finish points for the entire
                  race. A feature of this method is that the map gets a
                  lot of overprint around the common control. If there
                  are three loops, then the common control will be
                  visited no less than four times, meaning that eight
                  purple lines and four numbers have to be fitted around
                  it. The competitor must take great care to leave the
                  common control in the right direction each time;
                  running a loop in the wrong sequence or in the wrong
                  direction will result in disqualification.<br>

                conventional course, there should be no other control
                kites within 30m of the one you are looking for. In
                micro-O, there will be. Furthermore, there will be no <a

                check. You must therefore use your skill with the map to

                exactly in the centre of the circle on your map and fit

                not have to work all day every Wednesday. Details on the
                <a href="#BAOC">BAOC</a> web site. Events are always
                open to everyone, although occasionally advance notice
                of attendance and proof of identity may be required for
                security reasons. They can be anywhere in southern
                Britain, but tend to concentrate near the army bases
                near Aldershot and Salisbury Plain.<br>

              <dt>Mini Mass Start</dt>
              <dd><a href="#Relay">Relays</a> always have a <a
                  href="#Mass">mass</a> start for the first lap, with
                competitors running second or subsequent laps usually
                starting when the previous runner in their team
                finishes. Mini mass starts are a device for reducing the
                elapsed time taken by the slowest teams. Some time after
                all the runners for the teams in contention have
                started, the remaining runners on the same lap may be
                started together in a mini mass start, without waiting
                for their previous lap runners to finish.</dd>

                (whether paper or electronic) is said to have
                ¨mispunched¨. This will normally be because the
                competitor has accidentally missed out the control or
                visited the wrong control without realising. More
                rarely, competitor may have failed to operate the <a

                socialising rather than competition. Normally some sort
                of orienteering-related activity followed by food and
                drink. Mole Nights were first introduced in 2011, and
                are currently twice a month on Thursdays during the

              <dd>Mole Valley Map &amp; Compass Foot Racing Society. The
                formal name of Mole Valley Orienteering Club. The
                official explanation for this name is that when Mole
                Valley was formed, the term ¨orienteering¨ was not
                widely understood by the general public (so no change
                there then!), and a name was chosen to better describe
                the sport. The unofficial explanation is that our
                founder, Toby Norris, being a scientist, was keen to
                have the letters FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society) after
                his name.</dd>

                Constitutionally, they have similar status to the
                English <a href="#Region">Regional Associations</a>,
                although the Scottish Association is more independent
                and powerful than the others. Additionally, they are
                responsible for teams for the <a href="#HomeInt">Home
                  Internationals</a>. Just to make matters really
                confusing, there is also an English national association
                which is not a member of BOF, and seems to have little
                function beyond selecting home international teams!</dd>
              <dt><a name="National"></a>National (event)</dt>
              <dd>One of the functions of <a href="#BOF">BOF</a> is to
                periodically change the names which indicate the
                relative status of orienteering events. From May 2017,
                high quality events which are not major championships,
                but still aimed at people prepared to travel a fair
                distance (as well as those living locally) have been
                renamed from <a href="#Level">Level B</a> to
                "National". This is especially confusing as up to two
                reorganisations ago, "National" events were the top
                level. Broadly equivalent to Regional Events two
                re-organisations ago, and more important than Regional
                events now. The appropriateness of this grade name
                inflation can be judged from the fact that there are
                often simultaneous "National" events taking place in
                different parts of the nation. The higher level is now "<a
                  href="#Major">Major</a>" event, and the next level
                down is now "<a href="#Regional">Regional</a>" event. </dd>

                Orienteering after dark with a torch. The best night
                orienteers are nearly as quick at night as during the
                day. It's good fun. I recommend trying it, but not until
                you are reasonably confident in daylight. “Night” is
                perhaps a misnomer, it means “after dark”, but most
                events are on winter evenings, and finished by 9pm.
                There used to be a popular league of night events in the

                within a single <a href="#Region">BOF region</a>. Also
                referred to as <a href="#ColourC">Colour-coded&nbsp;events</a>

              <dt><a name="Relay"></a>Relay event</dt>
              <dd>A team event, usually for three people. Each person
                runs a separate course, or lap. Relays always have a <a

                subsequent runners starts when the previous team member
                finishes.
                <p>Each team will collectively run the same distance,
                  and eventually visit the same controls. However, the
                  courses for each team will be varied, or <a
                    href="#Gaffle">gaffled</a>, so that different teams
                  visit the controls in different sequences, thus
                  preserving some requirement to navigate rather than
                  follow the person in front. </p>
                <p>Relay entries are usually made by one person on

                Uses the same events as the <a href="#SELeague">South-East&nbsp;League</a>,
                but unlike the League, it runs over each calendar year.
                <p>There is a separate competition for each course; that
                  is, not just is each <a href="#AgeClass">age class</a>
                  scored separately, but also Long and Short or A and B
                  courses have their own ranking lists. The first member
                  of a SEOA club on each course at each event gets 100
                  points, the second 99 points, and so on. The points
                  accumulated at the various events over the year are
                  added to give the individuals total. It is not
                  necessary to run absolutely every event, since the
                  number of events which count is slightly smaller than
                  the total. For example, if there are six SE League
                  events during the year, the Galoppen will take the
                  best five scores.&nbsp;</p>

                competition between the member clubs of the <a
                  href="#SEOA">SEOA</a>. The SEOA committee choose which
                events will form part of the League, usually picking all
                the <a href="#Level">Level B</a> events scheduled for
                the region. The League is contested over each
                autumn/winter/spring season.
                <p>Individual orienteers score points for their runs. At
                  each event, the points scored by the members of each
                  club are aggregated to give club scores. The clubs are
                  then ranked in order of their scores. Finally,
                  South-East League points are allocated to the clubs
                  based on the club order from the event. At the end of
                  the season, the club with most points is the winner. </p>
                <p>Anyone completing any course at any South-East League
                  event scores at least one point. Runs on the <a
                    href="#String">string course</a>, <a href="#Colour">colour-coded&nbsp;courses</a>,
                  and slow completions of <a href="#AgeClass">age class</a>
                  courses score one point. Faster runs on age class
                  courses score points according to how fast the
                  individual has done against a target speed. </p>

              <dt><a name="SETeamScore"></a>South-East Team Score</dt>
              <dd>An annual <a href="#Score">score event</a> at which
                individual members' points are used to score an
                inter-club competition. Each club gets the aggregate
                points of its top twelve individual scorers from
                different <a href="#AgeClass">age classes</a>. The
                ¨different classes¨ requirement stops the competition
                being dominated by the younger adult males, and for most
                clubs means that almost all their younger, older, or
                female members have a significant chance of contributing
                to the club score.
                <p>The rules provide for ¨automatic running-up¨, which
                  basically means that club captains don't have to worry
                  about picking team or asking people to enter <a
                    href="#RunUp">running-up</a> an age class. Instead,
                  the organiser will use the event results to select the
                  twelve people, with running-up, who give each club the
                  best score. </p>
                <p>For example, if a club has two M40 runners who are
                  both expected to outscore all their M35's, without
                  automatic running-up, the club captain would have to
                  ask one of the M40's to enter as M35. With automatic
                  running-up, he doesn't have to worry, and if both
                  M40's do beat the M35's, then it will be the two M40
                  scores that count.&nbsp;</p>

                plastic tape. There may be a continuous length of tape,
                or there may merely be fragments hung intermittently
                from bushes. Taped routes are likely to lead you from
                the car park to the <a href="#Start">Start</a> and from
                the <a href="#Finish">Finish</a> back to the car park.
                You may also have to follow a taped route as part of
                your course, most commonly from the last control to the
                Finish.
                <p>The colour of the tapes used varies, but should not
                  be yellow or black. Yellow or yellow/black tapes have
                  a very specific meaning in orienteering; they indicate
                  danger, such as the top of a cliff. It is not usually
                  a good idea to follow them! </p>

                decided on entirely on time. Still not a race, in the
                sense that there is no running between controls.
                However, the time taken to solve each control problem is
                recorded, and a time penalty is added for getting the
                answer wrong. Fastest time (after penalties) wins,
                meaning that fast and nearly always right beats slow and
                right all the time. Further details on this <a

                control flag. The competitor is not allowed right up to
                the control site, but has to study it from a distance.

                from M/W35 upwards. There is no selection, so you don't
                have to be any good to enter. There are two qualifying
                days, and then a finals day. Although everyone gets the
                chance to run in a final, you may (depending on your
                age) have to be pretty useful to reach the ¨A¨ final,
                the winner of which becomes the World Champion. There
                are usually several Moles competing each year, although
                none of us has won yet.</dd>
