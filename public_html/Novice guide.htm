 <a name="What is orienteering anyway"></a>What is orienteering, anyway?</h3>
<p>Orienteering is a sport that combines running and navigating. Most
orienteering events take place in forests, though they can be run on any kind of
terrain, including open moorland, local parks, sand dunes, and even city streets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orienteering usually requires specially produced maps drawn at scales which
show a high level of detail.</p>
<p>Wherever it occurs, orienteering usually involves visiting pre-designated
places (we call them Controls) in a particular order. The winner of any
course is the person who has visited all the Controls on their particular course 
in the shortest time. This means thinking carefully about your route.
Sometimes it will be quickest to go round paths, sometimes the faster route is a
more direct one across rougher ground.</p>
<p>Orienteering can be a highly competitive sport, and our elite class athletes
compete at the very top level in world competition. But many people participate
in the sport for fun, and there are events throughout the year catering for the
very widest possible range of ages and ability levels. Many orienteers enjoy the social
side of the sport - seeing regular faces around the UK (and abroad too), and
making new friends from different walks of life. And speaking of 'walks' people participate
at their own pace - from fast taxing runs to comfortable jogs and leisurely
walks. The choice is yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mole Valley, like other orienteering clubs, welcomes members of all standards, women and men, 
and all ages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mole Valley has a number of permanent orienteering courses in local parks. 
These are a great way to try orienteering out without going to a formal event.

of orienteering event</h3>
<p>There are several different kinds of orienteering event in the UK. You can 
learn more about the different types of events and 'orienteering-speak' more 
generally at this web site's
<a href="http://www.mvoc.org/Jargon_Buster.htm">Orienteering
Jargon Buster</a> page.</p>
<p>The different events are organised in two ways which cut across each other. </p>
<p>One of these is separation by 'level'. These levels are:</p>

    colour of the door on the house). More sophisticated street events are

 <a name="Choosing the right course"></a>Choosing the right course</h3>
<p>Orienteering courses vary in both their length and their technical 
difficulty. The lengths quoted below are a rough guide only and may differ at 
the event you choose to go to. </p>
<p>Don't overestimate your ability. Courses may look relatively short, but the
more technically difficult ones are likely to involve going across country
rather than along paths. This could mean you have to go through undergrowth,
cross streams and so on. There will almost always be hills to climb. Climb is
measured for each course, and is presented in metres. Generally longer courses
have more climb.&nbsp;Courses are measured in a straight line from Control to
Control. You will almost certainly travel further than the course length
suggests, because you are unlikely to be able to go in a direct line from one 
Control to the next.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, it is best to start with an easier course and move up 
to a harder one. There is nothing to stop you doing two courses at the same 
event, using the first one as a 'taster'.</p>
<p>It is OK to retire at an event without completing the course. But it is not 
OK to do so without reporting that you've done this. Even if you retire you must 
go through the 'download' procedure covered later on under the heading 'After 
you've completed the course'. Why? The course officials will have a 
record that you have started. If they don't also get a record of you having been 
through the 'download' area you will be counted as 'missing in the forest'. The 
safety systems orienteers use mean a search party will have to be sent out for 
you in case you are hurt and needing assistance. </p>
<p>Orienteering courses are always measured in kilometres. 1km is 0.6
miles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the colours below you may see short, medium and long variants designed 
to offer a set level of difficulty but different distances. </p>

<p>The following assumes you have chosen a come and try it event or a Local event as your first experience of orienteering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you go to an orienteering event you will see a central point, maybe a 
group of cars or a tent, at which you can get information about the courses available 
and book yourself in. This area is known as Registration, and it
is the place where you formally enter the event. It is also a good place to look
for someone to help you understand what to do and give general advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you register you'll be asked for your name and age (orienteers are 
grouped within age bands). When  asked what your club is just say you
don't have one. You'll be recorded as 'IND', or 'independent'. Officially
you are allowed to compete in three events before you need to join a club. This
web site has information about <a href="Join%20Mole%20Valley.htm">joining Mole
Valley</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In return for the information you give you will get the following
things</p>

      You may get the map before you start or you may pick it up after you start. 
      The course will probably be pre-marked on it, though you may have to draw 
      it on yourself. The first thing to do when you get the map look for
        the scale. The two scales normally used are: 1:10,000 and 1:15,000.&nbsp;The
        scale refers to how distance is recorded on the map. At 1:10,000 one
        centimetre on the map represents one hundred metres on the ground, 
      whilst at 1:15,000 one centimetre on the map represents 150 metres on the 
      ground. </td>

      Your dibber is very important. It is what proves you have been to each control on 
      your course. 
      <p>Dibbers are part of an electronic system that is used to record 
      your progress round courses and produce personalised results for you on 
      the day and results for everyone to see after the event has finished. </p>
      <p>As a beginner you will hire a Dibber. It is a
small plastic wedge which loops over your finger. You can learn more about
electronic punching at the Mole Valley
      <a href="http://www.mvoc.org/Jargon_Buster.htm">Jargon
Buster</a> page. Go there and look up SportIdent. to see a picture.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Using this 
      system, when you have completed your course, you will 'download' the contents of your
electronic control card into a computer. It will be cumulated with the others from your course,
and results produced electronically. You should get a printout of your
'split times' - the time you took between each control - immediately. The full results  include
split times for every competitor at every control. Take a look at the these

      A sheet of paper listing all the controls on your course with a 
      description of the kind of feature they are on. These may be 'pictoral' 
      using symbols, or plain English. If they are pictoral, feel free to ask a 
      helper at the event to explain them to you. </td>

      At many local events you
        can choose your own start time. Often you can just turn up and start 
      when you are ready. If you have to select a time ask how far it is to the start, and how
        long it will take to walk there. The officials should be able to suggest 
      how long you should leave before your start time. </td>

 <a name="At the start"></a>At The Start&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When you get to the start you will see a clock. 'Call up' is usually three minutes before your actual start time. You progress through 
several boxes at one minute intervals till
you get to the actual start line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At many events where there are pre-marked maps those on the shorter, easier 
courses can collect their at the start before 'call up' time. This is so that 
they can check on their courses before starting to be timed, and get any help 
from officials they may want with understanding the map, or planning routes. For 
White, Yellow and Orange courses this is very often the case. Ask the officials 
if you are not sure whether you can see your course in advance. </p>
<p>Remember, you can ask the officials to explain anything you don't understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your last control is the Finish. When you have finished go to the download 
area which is likely to be in the car park. You MUST remember to go here in 
order that the officials know you have finished the event. You will hand back 
your hired Dibber here and collect a printout of your own individual results. There is usually a drink available - orange squash and/or water. Help
yourself. People often gather around the drinks area to discuss their courses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you enjoy your first orienteering event, you might want to take part in
some more. Look around in the car park for leaflets advertising forthcoming
events and take any that look interesting. Also, talk to the club officials and
ask them about forthcoming events. Use the links at this web site to find out
about other clubs in your area, and other orienteering events. You might even decide you want to become a
club member.&nbsp;Refer back to the section on <a href="#Finding out about events in your area">finding
